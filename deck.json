It was was such a success that Louis kept the original and sent him a copy instead. The original became Louis’ </span>official portrait<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and hung over Louis’ throne.

Indeed, the work cultivates the atmospheric and the romantic (the Danish Golden Age was inspired from the German Romanticism), while the flag accentuates the fact that we are looking at a Danish suburban landscape. Further, the flag links the painting to the nationalist sentiments that grew greatly in strength and scope around this time. Købke had a similar painting from the Sortedam Lake exhibited at Charlottenborg in 1838.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">The Biedermeier culture toned down the Romantics and embraced sentimentality rather than extreme emotion, relaxed hikes rather than nature worship, and community rather than individualism. Biedermeier morals/ mentality extended to countries such as Denmark, where this was painted</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Biedermier culture existed from the Congress of Vienna to the Revolution of 1848. The term comes from fictitious poet, Gottlieb Biedermeier, whose poems were in satirical newspaper in Munich in 1850s. Its simple verses celebrated bourgeois values such as simplicity, frugality, hard work and piety. Bieder means plain, solid and unpretentious. Meier refers to an administrator of an estate, that is a man who earned his money not with his hands (like a peasant) but with his brains. Art was an integral part of the Biedermeier home.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Danish Golden Age covers a period of exceptional creative production in Denmark, especially during the first half of the 19th century. Although Copenhagen had suffered from fires, bombardment and national bankruptcy, the arts took on a new period of creativity catalysed by Romanticism from Germany. A distinct national style for the first time since the Middle Ages; the period lasted until the middle of the century. It has a style drawing on Dutch Golden Age painting, especially its landscape painting, and depicting northern light that is soft but allows strong contrasts of colour. The treatment of scenes is typically an idealized version of reality, but unpretentiously so, appearing more realist than is actually the case. Interior scenes, often small portrait groups, are also common, with a similar treatment of humble domestic objects and furniture, often of the artist's circle of friends. Little Danish art was seen outside the country (indeed it mostly remains there to this day) although the Danish-trained leader of German Romantic painting Caspar David Friedrich was important in spreading its influence in Germany.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation.

In 1846, Baudelaire called for large-scale, serious works that depicted the modern life. Courbet, a friend of Baudelaire, embraced this call and painted A Burial at Ornans, shown in the Salon of 1850-51. It is a monumental representation of a middle-class burial in the French provinces. Unlike David's Death of Socrates (1787) and Delacroix's Death of Sardanapalus (1827-28), Courbet's image neither ennobles nor dramatizes death. Death is shown as what it is - a recurrent and unremarkable event.

Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the early 19th century. ... The movement aimed to focus on unidealized subjects and events that were previously rejected in art work. Realism was primarily concerned with how things appeared to the eye, rather than containing ideal representations of the world. The popularity of such \"realistic\" works grew with the introduction of photography—a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real. Depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social classes in a similar manner. Gloomy earth toned palettes were used to ignore beauty and idealization that was typically found in art. This movement sparked controversy because it purposefully criticized social values and the upper classes, as well as examining the new values that came along with the industrial revolution. Realist works depicted people of all classes in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions</span></div></li></ol></b>"

He was known for his subtle use of colour, often printed with multiple impressions in the same area and his extensive use of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">bokashi </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(color gradation), both of which were labor-intensive techniques.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the foreground is a tree branch, through which he frames a distant view of a daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) estate, which may indicate a more political theme than the print gives at first glance. The tree in the painting received its name due to one full-moon shaped contorted branch, a common natural phenomenon found in many old Japanese pines. It was believed that when a person examined the loop branch from different angles, the various moon phases could be observed.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;The print also shows Hiroshige’s experimentation in the vertical format.

Called “Mr. Lincoln’s Cameraman.” When the Civil War started, his use of a mobile studio and darkroom enabled vivid battlefield photographs that brought home the reality of war to the public. Thousands of war scenes were captured, as well as portraits of generals and politicians on both sides of the conflict, though most of these were taken by his assistants, rather than by Brady himself.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-weight: 400;\">Because exposure times were still so long it was impossible to document the action of war.

Overwhelms any romantic or sentimental notions about the glory of war. Some of these stagings were manipulated slightly by the photographers to make the images more succinct and powerful.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-weight: 400;\">Brady’s 1862 New York gallery exhibit, \"The Dead of Antietam,” featured then-unseen photographs of some of the 23,000 victims of the war’s bloodiest day, which shocked American society. “Brady has done something to bring home to us the </span><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 33, 34);\">terrible reality and earnestness of war</span><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-weight: 400;\">,\" a New York Times reviewer wrote. \"If he has not brought bodies and laid them in our door-yards and along the streets, he has done something very like it.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-weight: 400;\">Brady is credited with being the father of photojournalism. He can also be considered a pioneer in the orchestration of a \"corporate credit line.\" In this practice, every image produced in his gallery was labeled \"Photo by Brady\"; however, Brady dealt directly with only the most distinguished subjects and most portrait sessions were carried out by others. Many photographers disliked ceding credit for their images to Brady.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-weight: 400;\">Although this project was important to the history of photography, Brady spent a fortune on it and lost it all when the U.S. government did not purchase them for as much as he thought. Brady died in New York and was buried in an unmarked grave.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

He developed a method for stranding and </span>weaving wire cables<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, more durable than the hemp usually used for suspension bridges at the time. (He ultimately founded his own factory in Trenton to keep up with rising demand for the new cables.)</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Completed 12 structures 1844-69, including suspension bridges in Pittsburgh and at Niagara Falls.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roebling’s design for a bridge connecting Brooklyn and Manhattan was accepted in 1867, and he was appointed chief engineer of the project.

When they had dug deep enough, they backfilled the caissons with poured concrete and brick piers. Workers would often suffer from the bends on their way back to the surface.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1869, just before construction began, Roebling’s foot was crushed in a ferry accident, and he died from tetanus two weeks later.

While the middle and upper class experienced significant luxury, the peasant class existed on the brink of starvation. During the 1830s and 40s, a small group of journalists, politicians and intellectuals spoke up against this massive class divide.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this image, Doré illustrates an upper-class gathering in a garden in London. In the accompanying image, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Orange Court, Drury Lane, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doré depicts a London slum with people dressed in rags huddled together along a narrow alleyway, with no trees nor sky in sight. The disparity between these two groups is emphasized not only in the figures themselves, but in the way that Doré represents their environments, While the figures at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Holland House </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are crowded together, they gather comfortably, surrounded by greenery. Doré’s use of the vanishing point in both images also alludes to the divergent futures of each group – a magnificent illuminated estate versus the unseen end of a dark, shadowed alleyway</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around the time the article and images were published, change was finally enacted in a series of legislations – the Factory Act of 1878 restricted the work week to 56 hours, while other acts worked to improve housing, public hygiene and education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contemporary critics had severe reservations about the book. Doré disliked sketching in public so there were many errors of detail; it showed only the extremes of society, and Jerrold’s text was superficial. Both were transfixed by the deprivation, squalor and wretchedness of the lives of the poor, even though they realised that London was changing and some of the worst social evils were beginning to be addressed. Despite these criticisms, Doré’s work has become celebrated for its dramatic use of light and shade, and the power of his images to capture the atmosphere of mid-Victorian London.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

As settlers explored further west, Native Americans became a subject of particular fascination to scientists and photographers who sought to record and understand them anthropologically and ethnographically.

While the image was originally intended as merely one of a collection of topographical records, the image was quickly adopted into the realm of fine art, admired for its abstraction of textures.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

What was in the balance here? One weighty question concerned the role of art in society. Ruskin believed that art possessed the power to improve society. For him, this was accomplished chiefly through an artwork’s ability to represent nature faithfully. Whistler’s attempt to capture the dazzling effects of a fireworks display over the Thames through startling, explosive brushwork defied the critic’s understanding of nature as a product of divine creation. Whistler believed an artwork’s usefulness detracted from its aesthetic purpose. Whistler won the suit, but still ended up bankrupt.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

Impressionist pictures appear less politically charged as a result, placing emphasis on the modern leisure life. Leisure was new phenomenon on the late 19</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">century, and a by-product of capitalism; the middle class was no longer forced to work throughout the year in order to make a living.

Renoir was drawn to the mixed character of the crowd. George Riviere, a friend of Renoir’s, notes that the women in this image, whom the artist had coaxed into posing for him, were of working class origin, the type who would normally frequent such dances (Montmartre was a poor, rundown area).</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though it was partially painted on the spot, Renoir also made various preliminary studies.

Here, the brushwork helps animate the dance moment, creating a sense of the arbitrary moment. It also creates a break away from the Academic tradition: has no one focal point in the composition.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renoir was keen to present the painting as a genuine scene of Parisian life.
