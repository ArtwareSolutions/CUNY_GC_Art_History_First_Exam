Its </span>dynamic composition,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> guided by the </span>two crossing diagonals<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is unlike the static construction of David’s paintings in which horizontals and verticals dominate. Most strikingly, </span>the soft effeminate body of Endymion is distinct from the heroic male bodies featured in the work of David.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. &nbsp; The painting depicts </span>Endymion<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the shepherd as a man of ideal beauty </span>being visited at night by the goddess Diana in the form of moonbeam<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span>who puts him in eternal sleep so she could love him forever. A prepubescent Eros parts the branches<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that admit the light into the thicket where Endymion rests. In attempting to break away from the footsteps of his teacher, </span>Girodet chooses a mythological love scene <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more likely to have fascinated a baroque or rococo painter than David.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. &nbsp; </span>Androgynous bodies such as Endymion’s were not unknown in Classical art. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winckelmann had argued that there was a duality in the Greek ideal of physical beauty– the first mode was masculine, heroic and austere; the second was feminine, graceful and sensuous. </span>Feminine traits were particularly pronounced in adolescent youths who became lovers of the gods, such as Endymion.&nbsp;</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. &nbsp; </span>The theatrical lighting<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this painting also differs from that in David’s works. The deep woodland shadows are traversed by a curiously blue-tinted shift of light. </span>The light on Endymion’s body shows Girodet’s taste for the bizarre: his moonlit torso is bathed in a vaporous effect evoking renaissance works. It is this strangeness which heralds the emerging romantic sensibility.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. &nbsp; The increased preoccupation of David’s students with </span>androgynous bodies<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the early 1790s onwards has been attributed to various factors. On one hand, it has been interpreted as an act of rebellion against David’s relentless emphasis on the heroic nude. On the other,</span> the new emphasis on sensuality rather than heroism was seen as a reflection of a larger psycho-cultural change following the revolutionary years.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>In the wake of thousands of executions during the revolution, the new generation preferred sensitivity over heroism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and sympathized with the victim rather than the perpetrator.&nbsp;</span></div></b><br>"

In this work, Delacroix envisions the moments before Assyrian King Sardanapalus committed suicide upon the siege of his palace by rebels. In the painting, he watches stoicly as he ordered the murder all wives, pages, horses and dogs, and the destruction all his treasures, before the rebels had a chance to steal them.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The King is depicted as both judge and executioner, actor and spectator, reclining on the bed in a perfectly still pose that evokes a classical or Renaissance statue.

Its simple verses celebrated bourgeois values such as simplicity, frugality, hard work and piety. Bieder means plain, solid and unpretentious. Meier refers to an administrator of an estate, that is a man who earned his money not with his hands (like a peasant) but with his brains. Art was an integral part of the Biedermeier home.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Danish Golden Age covers a period of exceptional creative production in Denmark, especially during the first half of the 19th century. Although Copenhagen had suffered from fires, bombardment and national bankruptcy, the arts took on a new period of creativity catalysed by Romanticism from Germany. A distinct national style for the first time since the Middle Ages; the period lasted until the middle of the century. It has a style drawing on Dutch Golden Age painting, especially its landscape painting, and depicting northern light that is soft but allows strong contrasts of colour. The treatment of scenes is typically an idealized version of reality, but unpretentiously so, appearing more realist than is actually the case. Interior scenes, often small portrait groups, are also common, with a similar treatment of humble domestic objects and furniture, often of the artist's circle of friends. Little Danish art was seen outside the country (indeed it mostly remains there to this day) although the Danish-trained leader of German Romantic painting Caspar David Friedrich was important in spreading its influence in Germany.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

In 1841 he patented his discovery of the </span>calotype<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Greek for beautiful impression), like this salted paper print from a paper calotype negative. His innovative method used a high-quality writing </span>paper<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, photosensitized with chemical solutions, placed in a </span>camera<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and exposed to light to create a </span>negative<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from which many </span>positive prints<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could be made. This is the basic principle behind nearly all subsequent photography until the digital age.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. The calotype's advantage over the daguerreotype was that it could be printed on paper rather than silver foil, and that it was possible to make multiple prints from a single negative, its disadvantages were lack of sharpness and clarity.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. </span>Nelson's Column<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (1840-43) is a monument in </span>Trafalgar Square<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in London built to commemorate Admiral Horatio Nelson, who died during his great victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 (British navy victorious against France and Spain during Napoleonic Wars.)

He explained photographic process of image-making through the “agency of light alone,” and suggested uses for the new medium.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. The introduction of glass negatives in 1851 precipitated a decline in the use of paper negatives.

Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation. He associated his ideas of realism in art with political anarchism, and, having gained an audience, he promoted democratic and socialist ideas by writing politically motivated essays and dissertations.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Realism advocated by Charles Baudelaire: paint the ordinary aspects of contemporary life and to find in them some grand and epic quality; renounce allegory, nudity, and period costume; large- scale works. In 1846, Baudelaire called for large-scale, serious works that depicted the modern life. Courbet, a friend of Baudelaire, embraced this call and painted A Burial at Ornans, shown in the Salon of 1850-51. It is a monumental representation of a middle-class burial in the French provinces. Unlike David's Death of Socrates (1787) and Delacroix's Death of Sardanapalus (1827-28), Courbet's image neither ennobles nor dramatizes death. Death is shown as what it is - a recurrent and unremarkable event. Courbet's figures are uniformly dressed, suggesting that in the modern age, equality may be achieved.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Courbet's image created a scandal, it was called dull, boring, and criticized for glorifying a trivial subject. Throughout the image are also subtle criticisms of the Church, specifically the apparent alcoholism of one of the officials. Beneath the criticism was also fear stemming from the recent political changes.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Courbet's painting reminded viewers that it was the new republican regime of ordinary, provincial bourgeois that had emerged from the Revolution of 1848 with suffrage rights and political power. He asserts the importance of contemporary imagery rather than historical terms.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Monumental representation of a middle-class burial in the French provinces; Represents the ideas of his time in a contemporary rather than historical terms (ideals = equality) Death is the great equalizer, but here suggested that equality may be achieved during one's lifetime, thanks to revolutions of 1789 and 1848 (Second Republic 1848-1851, universal male suffrage) Men in painting represent large mass of new votes</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">His realism was most likely influenced by daguerreotype realism and all figures are shown as if of equal importance. The composition's intentionally 'naïf' approach was the perfect antidote to the bombastic air of Couture's Romans of the Decadence (1847) - the hit of the 1847 Salon, the year before the 1848 Revolution.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Brought Courbet instant fame; controversial. Scandalous at the salon. Attacked for being deliberately ugly. C considered it \"the burial of Romanticism.\" Artist looked popular woodcuts, engravings, and lithographs for sense of shadowlessness, stark color contrasts, superimposition of figures, and emotional neutrality.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">French Realism was an artistic movement that emerged in France in the 1840s, around the 1848 Revolution. Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the early 19th century. ... The movement aimed to focus on unidealized subjects and events that were previously rejected in art work. Realism was primarily concerned with how things appeared to the eye, rather than containing ideal representations of the world. The popularity of such \"realistic\" works grew with the introduction of photography—a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real. Depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social classes in a similar manner. Gloomy earth toned palettes were used to ignore beauty and idealization that was typically found in art. This movement sparked controversy because it purposefully criticized social values and the upper classes, as well as examining the new values that came along with the industrial revolution. Realist works depicted people of all classes in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions</span></div></li></ol></b>"
