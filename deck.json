Known as the Sun King, he was an </span>absolute monarch<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who consolidated and retained power over his vast kingdom despite challenges from French nobles and other rulers. Louis XIV is shown here in his coronation robes, although he was 63 years old at the time that the portrait was painted. The </span>blue-and-gold fleur-de-lys pattern<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the textiles and the </span>ermine fur<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over Louis’ shoulders are symbols of the French monarchy, which held that it was the divine right of kings to rule. The</span> royal sword<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hanging from his left hip, the </span>royal scepter<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in his hand, and the </span>crown<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> resting behind the scepter underscore his power. At 9’2” x 6’3”, the painting is massive, its imposing scale making the petite monarch tower over viewers.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The voluminous “</span>periwig<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” cravat, and red shoes worn by Louis in the portrait were signatures of </span>Baroque style<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, over which Louis exerted substantial influence: strict codes dictated what people could wear at court, based on their standing.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The portrait was commissioned for Louis’ grandson, King Philip V of Spain. It was was such a success that Louis kept the original and sent him a copy instead. The original became Louis’ </span>official portrait<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and hung over Louis’ throne. In his absence, courtiers were forbidden from turning their backs on it, as they would have been forbidden from turning their backs on the king.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Louis XIV was a great </span>supporter of the arts<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span>and used them to gather political capital. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The palace at </span>Versailles<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was his grandest and most expensive undertaking. By moving the French court in 1682 from Paris to Versailles, a former hunting lodge located 12 miles from the city, Louis was able to isolate nobles from the economic hub of Paris. By the time this portrait was painted, Louis had commissioned massive expansions at Versailles from various architects, as well as many new works of </span>theatre, music, dance, painting, and sculpture which premiered at court.&nbsp;</div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This portrait of Louis XIV - influenced by </span>Anthony Van Dyck’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Charles I Dismounted</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(1635) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">-</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cemented Rigaud’s reputation within Europe as a </span>painter of state portraits<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. His style was emulated in France until the French Revolution (1789). The painting was so popular that </span>Rigaud, with the help of assistants, made many copies<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at varying scales, at full as well as half length</span>.&nbsp;</div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The painting was shown at the Salon in 1704, and remained in the royal collection until the Revolution (1793), after which it entered the collection of the Musée Central des Arts de la République, later known as the Musée du Louvre.</span></div></li></ol><br><br></b>"

Its simple verses celebrated bourgeois values such as simplicity, frugality, hard work and piety. Bieder means plain, solid and unpretentious. Meier refers to an administrator of an estate, that is a man who earned his money not with his hands (like a peasant) but with his brains. Art was an integral part of the Biedermeier home.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Danish Golden Age covers a period of exceptional creative production in Denmark, especially during the first half of the 19th century. Although Copenhagen had suffered from fires, bombardment and national bankruptcy, the arts took on a new period of creativity catalysed by Romanticism from Germany. A distinct national style for the first time since the Middle Ages; the period lasted until the middle of the century. It has a style drawing on Dutch Golden Age painting, especially its landscape painting, and depicting northern light that is soft but allows strong contrasts of colour. The treatment of scenes is typically an idealized version of reality, but unpretentiously so, appearing more realist than is actually the case. Interior scenes, often small portrait groups, are also common, with a similar treatment of humble domestic objects and furniture, often of the artist's circle of friends. Little Danish art was seen outside the country (indeed it mostly remains there to this day) although the Danish-trained leader of German Romantic painting Caspar David Friedrich was important in spreading its influence in Germany.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

The introduction of glass negatives in 1851 precipitated a decline in the use of paper negatives.

Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation.

In 1846, Baudelaire called for large-scale, serious works that depicted the modern life. Courbet, a friend of Baudelaire, embraced this call and painted A Burial at Ornans, shown in the Salon of 1850-51. It is a monumental representation of a middle-class burial in the French provinces. Unlike David's Death of Socrates (1787) and Delacroix's Death of Sardanapalus (1827-28), Courbet's image neither ennobles nor dramatizes death. Death is shown as what it is - a recurrent and unremarkable event. Courbet's figures are uniformly dressed, suggesting that in the modern age, equality may be achieved.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Courbet's image created a scandal, it was called dull, boring, and criticized for glorifying a trivial subject.

The movement aimed to focus on unidealized subjects and events that were previously rejected in art work. Realism was primarily concerned with how things appeared to the eye, rather than containing ideal representations of the world. The popularity of such \"realistic\" works grew with the introduction of photography—a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real. Depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social classes in a similar manner. Gloomy earth toned palettes were used to ignore beauty and idealization that was typically found in art. This movement sparked controversy because it purposefully criticized social values and the upper classes, as well as examining the new values that came along with the industrial revolution. Realist works depicted people of all classes in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions</span></div></li></ol></b>"

He presented a design at once large and easy to construct using 3 types of modular units: glass panes set in wooden frames, iron girders on which the panes rested, and cast-iron supporting pillars to construct the building. That each of these units was identical significantly expedited the building process and lowered the cost of construction. They were prefabricated in different locations and then assembled on the spot over the course of 6 months in Hyde Park. This was a breakthrough in technology and design: being able to make buildings that are both gigantic and easy to construct.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the structure, Paxton demonstrated a highly sophisticated roofing system, “ridge-and furrow,” and ventilation system.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Airiness and exposure of all structural elements perfectly expressed the spirit of the new Industrial age and were unprecedented in a period where elaborately decorated historical revivalist buildings were the norm.

The texture of the carpet, the reflection in the mirror, the carvings of the furniture all speak to Hunt’s belief that the artists should recreate the scene as closely as possible, and paint from direct observation. To do that, he hired a room in the neighbourhood of St. John’s Wood to use as his setting.</span></div></b>"

At a time when flat lighting and long depth of field were standard, Cameron sought </span>expressive effects:<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contrast of light and shadow, varying qualities of light, shallow focus.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron defended the </span>distinction between art photography and \"professional\" photography<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (she proudly practiced the former).&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron, stylistically influenced by portraits by Rembrandt and Vélazquez, used the </span>collodion-albumen<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process: more difficult than the calotypes made by Talbot and others, but allowed her to achieve deeper chiaroscuro effects.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron sought to make portraits that depicted subjects’ </span>inner life<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rather than merely outward appearance. For this portrait, she had Herschel wash and tousle his hair to catch the light, draped him in black, brought her camera close to his face, and photographed him emerging from the darkness. Herschel liked this photograph best of the four exposures that Cameron made at this time: he thought it made him look like an “old Paterfamilias.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron was aware of the </span>commercial viability<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of her Herschel portraits: he was a famous figure, and her photography helped to&nbsp; support herself and her family. She registered them for copyright, and in June 1867 they were displayed at Colnaghi’s, a commercial art gallery and print publisher in London. The reviewer for the Athenaeum described them as “severely and grandly effective pictures of a noble head.” Cameron sent this work and several others to the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris, where she was awarded an honorable mention for “artistic photographs.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

While the middle and upper class experienced significant luxury, the peasant class existed on the brink of starvation. During the 1830s and 40s, a small group of journalists, politicians and intellectuals spoke up against this massive class divide.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this image, Doré illustrates an upper-class gathering in a garden in London. In the accompanying image, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Orange Court, Drury Lane, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doré depicts a London slum with people dressed in rags huddled together along a narrow alleyway, with no trees nor sky in sight. The disparity between these two groups is emphasized not only in the figures themselves, but in the way that Doré represents their environments, While the figures at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Holland House </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are crowded together, they gather comfortably, surrounded by greenery. Doré’s use of the vanishing point in both images also alludes to the divergent futures of each group – a magnificent illuminated estate versus the unseen end of a dark, shadowed alleyway</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around the time the article and images were published, change was finally enacted in a series of legislations – the Factory Act of 1878 restricted the work week to 56 hours, while other acts worked to improve housing, public hygiene and education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contemporary critics had severe reservations about the book. Doré disliked sketching in public so there were many errors of detail; it showed only the extremes of society, and Jerrold’s text was superficial. Both were transfixed by the deprivation, squalor and wretchedness of the lives of the poor, even though they realised that London was changing and some of the worst social evils were beginning to be addressed. Despite these criticisms, Doré’s work has become celebrated for its dramatic use of light and shade, and the power of his images to capture the atmosphere of mid-Victorian London.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

As settlers explored further west, Native Americans became a subject of particular fascination to scientists and photographers who sought to record and understand them anthropologically and ethnographically.

While the image was originally intended as merely one of a collection of topographical records, the image was quickly adopted into the realm of fine art, admired for its abstraction of textures.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

What was in the balance here? One weighty question concerned the role of art in society. Ruskin believed that art possessed the power to improve society. For him, this was accomplished chiefly through an artwork’s ability to represent nature faithfully. Whistler’s attempt to capture the dazzling effects of a fireworks display over the Thames through startling, explosive brushwork defied the critic’s understanding of nature as a product of divine creation.

Renoir was drawn to the mixed character of the crowd. George Riviere, a friend of Renoir’s, notes that the women in this image, whom the artist had coaxed into posing for him, were of working class origin, the type who would normally frequent such dances (Montmartre was a poor, rundown area).</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though it was partially painted on the spot, Renoir also made various preliminary studies. The framing of the scene in which the figures on the sides are cut off, gives the impression that it continues beyond its bounds and that this is a slice of reality.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renoir was the first to apply Impressionistic brushwork of their landscapes to figure paintings and genre scenes. Here, the brushwork helps animate the dance moment, creating a sense of the arbitrary moment. It also creates a break away from the Academic tradition: has no one focal point in the composition.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renoir was keen to present the painting as a genuine scene of Parisian life. However, this has been contended to untrue: described as a contrived image, largely populated by Renoirs middle class friends enjoying the company of lower class women– the image of carefree enjoyment is essential an ideal.</span></div></b>"

It was later published as a book and reached a wider audience. In it he described the squalid living conditions of the slums, where people lived without ventilation or sanitation in cramped, overcrowded rooms. He described this scene: “It was photographed by flash-light on just such a visit. In a room not thirteen feet either way slept twelve men and women, two or three in bunks set in a sort of alcove, the rest on the floor. A kerosene lamp burned dimly in the fearful atmosphere, probably to guide other and later arrivals to their ‘beds,’ for it was only just past midnight. A baby’s fretful wail came from an adjoining hall-room, where, in the semi-darkness, three recumbent figures could be made out. The ‘apartment’ was one of three in two adjoining buildings we had found, within half an hour, similarly crowded. Most of the men were lodgers, who slept there for five cents a spot.”&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Riis was a journalist, not an artist, but he used a brand new photographic technique: </span>flash powder<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Flash powder was a mixture of magnesium with potassium chlorate and some antimony sulfide for added stability. Riis lit the magnesium powder on a frying pan. The process involved removing the lens cap, igniting the flash powder and replacing the lens cap; the time taken to ignite the flash powder sometimes allowed a visible image blurring created by the flash. The introduction of flash photography made it possible for Riis to photograph the darkest corners of society, like this overcrowded lodging room with no light. It also allowed him to take photos at night when the worst conditions were most apparent.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of flash photography to </span>document the dark places<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the city where no one willingly ventured allowed Riis to capture the unflinching realities of life in the city and bring it to those who had the power to make change.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outcry from Riis’ journalistic photography brought about a</span> reform<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> movement.

Initially, posters were covered walls of urban buildings, but were eventually considered a uniquely modern phenomenon that poster exhibitions were held across France and posters became a collectors’ item.

A competition was held for the design of the system’s entrances, and although Guimard never formally entered the competition, the young architect was offered the commission for his avant-garde designs, which employed mass produced cast-iron components to facilitate efficient manufacture, transportation and assembly. Additionally, the modular design of the stations enabled many dozens to be assembled in a period of only a few years.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entrance to the Porte Dauphine is one of eight entrances labelled the “Édicule B” type: simpler but still elaborate structures that consisted of three-sided glass roofed structures enclosing the stairway, with a projecting canopy.

In 1898, she joined the </span>Worpswede<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> artist colony, near Bremen, where she met and married painter Otto Modersohn. She soon grew impatient with the sentimental naturalism of the Worpswede painters and in 1900 made the first of several long trips to </span>Paris<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where she found inspiration in the works of Cézanne, Gauguin, and van Gogh.

As she sought to reinvent the representation of women in Western art history, her most radical step was in taking herself as a subject, likely becoming the </span>first modern woman artist to have painted nude and pregnant self-portraits.</div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her diaries and letters were published in 1917.</span></div></li></ol></b><br>"

Instead, they insisted upon the artistic possibilities of camera-made imagery, but held that these could be realized only when art and science had been combined to serve both truth and beauty.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Stieglitz maintained a strict “truth to materials” position, creating highly expressive images without the aid of darkroom enhancement, he was an important forerunner of so-called “straight” photography. The straight photographer exploits the intrinsic properties of the camera to make photographs that look like photographs instead of imitations of paintings or fine-art prints. This image marks his transition away from more painterly Pictorialist prints of Symbolist subjects to a more straightforward depiction of quotidian life.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He established the </span>Photo-Secession<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> group in 1902 to promote “the serious recognition of photography as an additional medium of pictorial expression.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this image, taken during a voyage to Europe, Stieglitz selected as his subject the steerage where the cheapest accommodations were. He avoids the slightest Pictorialist sentiment or anecdote, providing instead a straight document of the scene that was not merely a crowd of immigrants but a study of line, shape and light. By using photography to elevate formal qualities, engaging the same dialogues around abstraction that preoccupied European avant-garde painters, he elevated photography from a mimic of painting to a wholly formed and unique art form in itself.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four years later he published the photo on the cover of his magazine Camera Work at which point it was highly celebrated.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

Boxing was a controversial subject at the time (public boxing matches were banned in New York State in 1900), but the interracial theme in which the black boxer appears to be winning made the painting even more so.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The painting is likely a reference to the recent and much publicized success of the African-American prizefighter Jack Johnson, who had won the world heavyweight championship in 1908. Painted at the height of the Jim Crow era, Bellows delineation of a white fighter about to be defeated by a black opponent was a provocative piece of social commentary.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Bellows’ brushstrokes underscore the violence and physicality of the match. The paint is applied with a quickness that echoes the energetic movement of the athletes. The forms, while distinct, are not delicately rendered. The obscure darkness of the background precludes any perception of recession into space, and create the feeling of a dangerous and secretive atmosphere.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bellows painting also reflects a contemporary interest in crowd psychology. He claimed, “the atmosphere around the fighters is a lot more immoral than the fighters themselves.” He exaggerates the faces of the onlookers; they grimace and shout at the drama above them. His incisive depiction of the audience reveals the influence of 19</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">century French caricaturist Honoré Daumier.&nbsp;</span></div></b>"

It may have been his passion to express his reality in the most concrete terms possible, as an organic abstraction (or as he termed it, organic concretion) that led him from painting to collage.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The work, like his other collages, was created by tearing paper into pieces, letting them fall to the floor and pasting each scrap where it happened to land. Rather than ordering the page according to his own design, he ceded control to the random hand of gravity, thus also giving him a solution to his problems of composition with which he had been struggling.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liberated from rational thought processes, the laws of chance, Arp felt, were more in tune with the working of nature.

He served as the third and last director of the </span>Bauhaus<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Dessau from 1930 to 1933.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His work is unmistakable in its </span>clarity<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span>rigor<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with which it embodies the principles of </span>rationalism and functionalism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as in its spatial qualities, material expression and detailing. Mies had four guiding principles: the search for </span>clarity of construction<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; reduction to a </span>few formal elements<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span>simple architectural design<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; a constructional logic derived from the </span>materials<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; and the principle of simplicity and </span>continuity between indoors and outdoors<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Space for Mies was something that continues beyond its physical limits and creates connections between inside and outside.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Mies, </span>technological advances<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were a driving force of architecture, a spirit of the times that architecture should embrace and express.&nbsp; Between 1921 and 1925 he developed five visionary studies, including this </span>amoeba-like design<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Glass Skyscraper</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (1922) consisting of a core and three wings with rounded forms, which followed his radical proposal for the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Friedrichstrasse Skyscraper Project</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (1921), the first example of his </span>“skin-and-bones” architecture<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that was to dominate his later designs. Although none of the five projects were realized because they were highly </span>idealized<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they were presented in international exhibitions on modern architecture. To this day, they are regarded as remarkably innovative designs and </span>the degree zero<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of his career and of a certain strain of modern architecture.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of </span>glass<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a material for Mies is evident in this design, where the ‘window’ as a link to the surroundings and indicator of human scale was replaced by a facade of continuous glass planes that responds universally to its surroundings and became generalized as an expression of the </span>International Style<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It also reflected the more fantastic visions of </span>Expressionist<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> architects and artists, who were drawn to glass as a symbol of purity and renewal. Mies interpreted </span>transparency<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in two respects: literally, as a property of light- and air-permeable materials and figuratively, as a means of spatial arrangement in which different spaces can be seen at once.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unprecedented design is distinguished by its </span>crystalline plan, the daring use of glass<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and an </span>expressive silhouette<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that seemed to owe nothing to history. Conceived only a few years after the end of WWI, this seminal project presented a bold vision of the skyscraper as a </span>new architectural typology for the modern metropolis<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, anticipating the proliferation of the tall steel-and-glass buildings that have since become ubiquitous in cities worldwide.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A decade later Mies took part, together with Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and J.J.P. Oud, in the ‘</span>Modern Architecture’ (1932<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) </span>exhibition<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> curated by Philip Johnson and Henry-Russel Hitchcock at the </span>MoMA<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in New York, catapulting him into the limelight in the USA.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

As Fuller put it, “that is the Dymaxion principle of doing ever more with ever less weight, time, and ergs per each given level of functional performance.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 100 sqm hexagonal house (Fuller’s later versions of the designs were rounded) was an earthquake and storm resistant structure, supported by a central pole from which cables would be suspended, allowing the outer walls to be non-bearing. The Dymaxion's round shape minimized heat loss and the amount of materials needed, while also lending it strength.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By grouping all permanent utilities in the central pole, and letting the rest of the interior space remain modular, Fuller created a </span>flexible plan<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that would allow tenants to transform the space according to their needs.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Dymaxion was abandoned by Fuller until 1944, when the </span>post-War housing shortage <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">urged Fuller to revisit his previous idea of mass production of residential units. To make the house a reality, Fuller soon signed a two year research contract with Beech Aircraft industries, who held an abundance of aluminum in the aftermath of World War II. In 1946 Fuller completed two prototypes: the Barwise prototype and the Danbury prototype, though neither were assembled nor mass produced, mainly due to Fuller’s unwillingness to compromise.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fuller was accused of being overly </span>technical<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the expense of </span>aesthetic<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> merit, a charge to which he responded, \"I never work with aesthetic considerations in mind, but I have a test: if something isn't beautiful when I get finished with it, it's no good.\"</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fuller went on to teach at </span>Black Mountain College<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a nexus of modern art where students included Ruth Asawa, Elaine de Kooning, Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, Dorothea Rockburne, and Cy Twombly. Other teachers included John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and Josef and Anni Albers.</span></div></li></ol><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun fact: The Dymaxion only weighs about 3000 pounds versus the 150 tons of an average home (Fuller liked to ask people how much their house weighed), and would have cost about the same as an average car.</span></div></b>"

His work as an artist was inextricably tied to his social activism. His&nbsp; paintings, murals and posters addressed fascism, social injustice and the hardships endured by the poor working class. His works are often critical of American life, but by exposing social problems, Shahn hoped to inspire reform.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The subject of this painting was prompted by the arrest, trial and execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who were accused of murdering two men during an armed robbery in 1920. The pair’s conviction was met with widespread opposition, believed to&nbsp; have been convicted because of their political sympathies. At the time, many laborers, artists and intellectuals embraced leftist or socialist ideas and Sacco and Vanzetti were seen as symbols of the government’s suppression of political opposition.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahn followed the case closely and participated in protests in support of their release. He made 23 images about the subject, based on photographs that appeared&nbsp; in newspapers. These paintings were bitter denunciations of the American legal system, which had condemned them to death despite official doubts about their guilt.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this image, Sacco and Vanzetti lie in coffins in the foreground in front of a colonnaded neoclassical courthouse. On the porch behind them hangs a portrait of the trial judge Webster Thayer. Towering over the bodies are the members of the committee that reviewed their convictions. Shahn’s portraits are embedded in irony– Thayer raises his right hand as if taking an oath of justice, but faces a lamppost&nbsp; that resembles the bundle of sticks known as fasces, a symbol for Italian fascism and oppression in the 1920s.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The&nbsp; title of the work draws a connection to Christian martyrdom (Passion of Christ). Shahn also painted in tempera, a matte medium used by Italian Renaissance artists for Christian panel paintings. His composition invokes the images of the Lamentation of Christ but the expressions of the Committee members reveal a placid resolve rather than sorrow.</span></div></b>"

He explained, “the steel industry itself has tremendous plastic beauty,...it is as beautiful as the early Aztec or Mayan sculptures.” The assembly of the motor is depicted on the bottom half of the North wall.

Abbott, like Mumford, was hopeful that through urban planning, Americans would be able to wrest control of their cities away from paleotechnic forces and bring about a more humane “neotechnic” era. Their ideologies are evident in her photographs from this era, composed to make the buildings look downright menacing.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The status and prestige that Abbott enjoyed in Paris did not carry over to the male-dominated field of American photography, rooted firmly in Pictorialism. She critiqued the&nbsp; works of Steichen and Steiglitz for their tendency to romanticize the American landscape, and as a result was unable to secure spaces at galleries or have her work shown at museums.</span></div></b>"

He is best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sculpture is an expression of the single most important theme of Henry Moore's art, </span>the reclining figure.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which the female form is related to landscape to create images resonant with allusions to procreation, motherhood, mother-child relationships and the relationship of all human life to the earth.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">'Four-Piece Composition' is an extreme manifestation of Moore's interest, at this time and later, in the idea of splitting the human figure into parts. It is a carving in marble comprising four separate elements positioned on a marble base. The individual elements of the sculpture do not accurately resemble human body parts, but when seen together, and in accordance with the work's title, the four pieces may be understood as individual limbs. Although they are positioned in a compact arrangement none of the four pieces of the sculpture touch each other.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore commented 'I realised what an advantage a separated two-piece composition could have in relating figures to landscape. Knees and breasts are mountains. Once these two parts become separated you don't expect it to be a naturalistic figure: therefore you can justifiably make it like a landscape or a rock.'</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four-Piece Composition demonstrates how Moore combined such seemingly opposed currents as </span>Constructivism (abstract design) and Surrealism (psychological engagement with the work<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a statement released by Unit One, the group Moore associated with, sculpture \"had two definite objects: </span>the pursuit of form (as in abstract art) and the attempt to trace the psyche (as in Surrealism)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\"</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ideological service of his work was to humanize abstraction, and to keep it within the realm of art. He also promotes a type of Surrealism in which natural analogies were favored over psychological provocations. For Moore, it was important to </span>retain nature as the primary reference for sculpture, and he avowed a truth to materials<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Four-Piece Composition he inscribed partial profiles on the surface, as if to pull the sculpture away from total abstraction towards a semi figurative reading. He looked to preclassical and primitive sources for \"a world view\" of sculpture, and in the process renewed a commitment to direct carving as an almost ethical value. By opening up the masses and creating dispersed groups he studied various kinds of space relationships in sculpture.</span></div></li></ol></b></div></b></b>"

This group of muralists drew on Mexico’s </span>precolonial<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> past, and in 1924, signed a declaration repudiating </span>easel painting<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an aristocratic, colonial form. They favored “</span>monumental art<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in all its forms, because it is public property...art must no longer be the expression of individual satisfaction, which it is today, but should aim to become a fighting, educative </span>art for all.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” To this end, the muralists often depicted the lives and history of the proletariat in their work.

Influenced by </span>Surrealism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, free association, </span>automatism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and psychoanalysis, the course included an exercise in which a canvas was placed on the ground and paint was thrown on it directly from the cans of paint, which had had a hole poked into them. This was, for Siqueiros, a first step of artistic creation, in which the artist had to engage with the work using his entire body. He called this the \"controlled accident\" in painting. The workshop attracted young artists from Latin America and the US, including </span>Jackson Pollock, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whose drip paintings show the influence of Siqueiros’ methods.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workshop closed in April 1937, when Siqueiros joined the Republican Army to fight in the Spanish Civil War against Francisco Franco’s fascist coup.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siqueiros based </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Echo of a Scream</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a news photo of a child in the aftermath of a bombing in the Sino-Japanese war.

This fusion of the regional spirit with a </span>contemporary approach to design<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> produced a house that I would never have built in Europe with its entirely different climatic, technical and psychological background.” He combined materials consistent with other architecture in the region, including a common brick facade and local clapboard, with manufactured glass windows and stark white paint.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breuer designed a large portion of the furniture for the house, much of which featured his signature bent chrome tubes.&nbsp;</span></div></li></ol></b>"

Back in New York, she established a gallery called “Art of This Century” where she exhibited and sold work by the surrealists alongside work by Americans, exposing American audiences to European avant-garde movements, and providing a venue for American artist to thrive alongside the more established European modernists. For her 1942 exhibition she commissioned Kiesler to build a specially designed curved space in which to exhibit the work.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiesler was a young associate of the De Stijl group who had become known for his avant-garde theater designs</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For “Art of This Century” he divided the exhibition into four spaces, one for temporary shows and three for fixed exhibitions of the collection.

He omits the black, linear structure balanced against color areas. The process is instead reversed– the grid itself is in color,and the ground is a single plane of off-white. Bouncing against&nbsp; each other, the tiny blinking blocks of color create a vital and pulsing rhythm, an optical vibration that jumps between intersections evoking traffic on the streets of New York.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In New York, Mondrian devised a method of composing with commercially available colored tapes that he could easily shift around until he was satisfied with the composition to commit to paint the&nbsp; canvas.

In Spain he fought on the side of the Republicans during the Civil War, a fact that endeared him to Picasso when he moved to Paris. Lam spent eighteen years in Europe (1923-41), which deeply affected his artistic vision. While there, he befriended Picasso and also established himself as an integral member of the Surrealist movement. He explored imagery that was heavily influenced by Picasso, Cubism, and African art. Lam left Paris because of World War II, eventually traveling with Breton to Martinique, where they were joined by Masson.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artistic and cultural traditions of Lam's homeland and Europe converged when he returned to Cuba and renewed his familiarity with its light, vegetation, and culture. In The Jungle the presence of the woman-horse, who in Afro-Cuban mysticism refers to a spirit in communication with the natural world, mirrors Lam's own confrontational dialogue with the so-called primitive interests expressed in advanced European painting. His work is an example of this confluence of two cultures.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lam painted The Jungle, his masterpiece, two years after returning to his native Cuba from Europe, where he had been a member of the Surrealist movement. The work, \"intended to communicate a psychic state,\" Lam said, depicts a group of figures with crescentshaped faces that recall African or Pacific Islander masks, against a background of vertical, striated poles suggesting Cuban sugarcane fields. Together these elements obliquely address the history of slavery in colonial Cuba.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this monumental and thematically complex gouache, masked figures simultaneously appear and disappear amid the thick foliage of sugarcane and bamboo. The multiperspectival rendering of these figures mirrors Cubist vocabulary, while the fantastical moonlit scene around these monstrous beings—half man, half animal—emerging out of a primeval jungle evokes the realm of the Surrealists. In his desire to express the spirit of Afro-Cuban culture, in particular that of the uprooted Africans \"who brought their primitive culture, their magical religion, with its mystical side in close correspondence with nature,\" Lam reinforces the Surrealist aspect of this work</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based in part on the Cuban religion of Santería, which blends mystical and ritualistic traditions from Africa with old-world Catholicism, The Jungle presents a dense tropical landscape populated by odd, long-limbed creatures whose disjointed heads resemble African masks. These human-animal hybrids,who assemble in a lush dreamscape, give evidence of the artist's Surrealist background.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lam returned to France in 1952, though he continued to travel widely and visit Cuba.

His work was seen as indicative of an American self-reliance and independence. His paintings of the mid-1940s, usually involving some degree of figuration, were coarse and heavy, but filled&nbsp; with a nervous, brutal energy all of their own.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. &nbsp; The&nbsp; landscapes of Ryder as well as the work of Mexican muralists were important sources for Pollock’s violently expressive early paintings, as were methods of Míro. In 1939, MoMA mounted a large Picasso exhibition, which was a catalyst for Abstract Expressionists like Pollock to learn from his example and forge their own independent styles out of Cubism.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. &nbsp; Like other members of the New York School, Pollock was influenced in his early work by the Surrealists’ concept of the unconscious. In the late 1930s, he introduced imagery based on totemic or mythic figures, ideographic signs, and ritualistic events, which have been interpreted as pertaining to the buried experiences and cultural memories of the psyche.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. &nbsp; The imagery of this work is considered to have been influenced by ritual Navajo sand painting and references a Native American myth. Against the backdrop of a blue sky, a woman with a crown of feathers wields a knife, attempting to slash the moon. The blue background is overshadowed by red splashes, indicating a domination of violence and bloodshed in the modern world.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. &nbsp; Carl Jung’s theories of the collective unconscious as a repository for ancient myths and universal archetypes were a frequent topic of discussion in Abstract Expressionist circles. Pollock underwent psychoanalysis with Jungian analysts beginning in 1939. The psychic content of his early works have therefore been interpreted through Jungian themes.&nbsp;</span></div></b><br>"
