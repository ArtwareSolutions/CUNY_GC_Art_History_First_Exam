Known as the Sun King, he was an </span>absolute monarch<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who consolidated and retained power over his vast kingdom despite challenges from French nobles and other rulers. Louis XIV is shown here in his coronation robes, although he was 63 years old at the time that the portrait was painted. The </span>blue-and-gold fleur-de-lys pattern<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the textiles and the </span>ermine fur<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over Louis’ shoulders are symbols of the French monarchy, which held that it was the divine right of kings to rule. The</span> royal sword<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hanging from his left hip, the </span>royal scepter<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in his hand, and the </span>crown<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> resting behind the scepter underscore his power.

It was was such a success that Louis kept the original and sent him a copy instead. The original became Louis’ </span>official portrait<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and hung over Louis’ throne. In his absence, courtiers were forbidden from turning their backs on it, as they would have been forbidden from turning their backs on the king.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Louis XIV was a great </span>supporter of the arts<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span>and used them to gather political capital. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The palace at </span>Versailles<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was his grandest and most expensive undertaking. By moving the French court in 1682 from Paris to Versailles, a former hunting lodge located 12 miles from the city, Louis was able to isolate nobles from the economic hub of Paris. By the time this portrait was painted, Louis had commissioned massive expansions at Versailles from various architects, as well as many new works of </span>theatre, music, dance, painting, and sculpture which premiered at court.&nbsp;</div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This portrait of Louis XIV - influenced by </span>Anthony Van Dyck’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Charles I Dismounted</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(1635) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">-</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cemented Rigaud’s reputation within Europe as a </span>painter of state portraits<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Indeed, the work cultivates the atmospheric and the romantic (the Danish Golden Age was inspired from the German Romanticism), while the flag accentuates the fact that we are looking at a Danish suburban landscape. Further, the flag links the painting to the nationalist sentiments that grew greatly in strength and scope around this time. Købke had a similar painting from the Sortedam Lake exhibited at Charlottenborg in 1838.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">The Biedermeier culture toned down the Romantics and embraced sentimentality rather than extreme emotion, relaxed hikes rather than nature worship, and community rather than individualism. Biedermeier morals/ mentality extended to countries such as Denmark, where this was painted</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Biedermier culture existed from the Congress of Vienna to the Revolution of 1848. The term comes from fictitious poet, Gottlieb Biedermeier, whose poems were in satirical newspaper in Munich in 1850s. Its simple verses celebrated bourgeois values such as simplicity, frugality, hard work and piety. Bieder means plain, solid and unpretentious. Meier refers to an administrator of an estate, that is a man who earned his money not with his hands (like a peasant) but with his brains. Art was an integral part of the Biedermeier home.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Danish Golden Age covers a period of exceptional creative production in Denmark, especially during the first half of the 19th century. Although Copenhagen had suffered from fires, bombardment and national bankruptcy, the arts took on a new period of creativity catalysed by Romanticism from Germany. A distinct national style for the first time since the Middle Ages; the period lasted until the middle of the century. It has a style drawing on Dutch Golden Age painting, especially its landscape painting, and depicting northern light that is soft but allows strong contrasts of colour. The treatment of scenes is typically an idealized version of reality, but unpretentiously so, appearing more realist than is actually the case. Interior scenes, often small portrait groups, are also common, with a similar treatment of humble domestic objects and furniture, often of the artist's circle of friends. Little Danish art was seen outside the country (indeed it mostly remains there to this day) although the Danish-trained leader of German Romantic painting Caspar David Friedrich was important in spreading its influence in Germany.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation.

In 1846, Baudelaire called for large-scale, serious works that depicted the modern life. Courbet, a friend of Baudelaire, embraced this call and painted A Burial at Ornans, shown in the Salon of 1850-51. It is a monumental representation of a middle-class burial in the French provinces. Unlike David's Death of Socrates (1787) and Delacroix's Death of Sardanapalus (1827-28), Courbet's image neither ennobles nor dramatizes death. Death is shown as what it is - a recurrent and unremarkable event. Courbet's figures are uniformly dressed, suggesting that in the modern age, equality may be achieved.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Courbet's image created a scandal, it was called dull, boring, and criticized for glorifying a trivial subject.

Beneath the criticism was also fear stemming from the recent political changes.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 83, 88); font-weight: 400;\">Courbet's painting reminded viewers that it was the new republican regime of ordinary, provincial bourgeois that had emerged from the Revolution of 1848 with suffrage rights and political power.

Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the early 19th century. ... The movement aimed to focus on unidealized subjects and events that were previously rejected in art work. Realism was primarily concerned with how things appeared to the eye, rather than containing ideal representations of the world. The popularity of such \"realistic\" works grew with the introduction of photography—a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real. Depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social classes in a similar manner. Gloomy earth toned palettes were used to ignore beauty and idealization that was typically found in art. This movement sparked controversy because it purposefully criticized social values and the upper classes, as well as examining the new values that came along with the industrial revolution. Realist works depicted people of all classes in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions</span></div></li></ol></b>"

He was known for his subtle use of colour, often printed with multiple impressions in the same area and his extensive use of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">bokashi </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(color gradation), both of which were labor-intensive techniques.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the foreground is a tree branch, through which he frames a distant view of a daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) estate, which may indicate a more political theme than the print gives at first glance. The tree in the painting received its name due to one full-moon shaped contorted branch, a common natural phenomenon found in many old Japanese pines. It was believed that when a person examined the loop branch from different angles, the various moon phases could be observed.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;The print also shows Hiroshige’s experimentation in the vertical format.

Called “Mr. Lincoln’s Cameraman.” When the Civil War started, his use of a mobile studio and darkroom enabled vivid battlefield photographs that brought home the reality of war to the public. Thousands of war scenes were captured, as well as portraits of generals and politicians on both sides of the conflict, though most of these were taken by his assistants, rather than by Brady himself.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-weight: 400;\">Because exposure times were still so long it was impossible to document the action of war.

He can also be considered a pioneer in the orchestration of a \"corporate credit line.\" In this practice, every image produced in his gallery was labeled \"Photo by Brady\"; however, Brady dealt directly with only the most distinguished subjects and most portrait sessions were carried out by others. Many photographers disliked ceding credit for their images to Brady.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 33, 34); font-weight: 400;\">Although this project was important to the history of photography, Brady spent a fortune on it and lost it all when the U.S. government did not purchase them for as much as he thought.

During the 1830s and 40s, a small group of journalists, politicians and intellectuals spoke up against this massive class divide.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this image, Doré illustrates an upper-class gathering in a garden in London. In the accompanying image, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Orange Court, Drury Lane, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doré depicts a London slum with people dressed in rags huddled together along a narrow alleyway, with no trees nor sky in sight.

Doré’s use of the vanishing point in both images also alludes to the divergent futures of each group – a magnificent illuminated estate versus the unseen end of a dark, shadowed alleyway</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around the time the article and images were published, change was finally enacted in a series of legislations – the Factory Act of 1878 restricted the work week to 56 hours, while other acts worked to improve housing, public hygiene and education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contemporary critics had severe reservations about the book. Doré disliked sketching in public so there were many errors of detail; it showed only the extremes of society, and Jerrold’s text was superficial. Both were transfixed by the deprivation, squalor and wretchedness of the lives of the poor, even though they realised that London was changing and some of the worst social evils were beginning to be addressed. Despite these criticisms, Doré’s work has become celebrated for its dramatic use of light and shade, and the power of his images to capture the atmosphere of mid-Victorian London.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

As settlers explored further west, Native Americans became a subject of particular fascination to scientists and photographers who sought to record and understand them anthropologically and ethnographically.

What was in the balance here? One weighty question concerned the role of art in society. Ruskin believed that art possessed the power to improve society. For him, this was accomplished chiefly through an artwork’s ability to represent nature faithfully. Whistler’s attempt to capture the dazzling effects of a fireworks display over the Thames through startling, explosive brushwork defied the critic’s understanding of nature as a product of divine creation. Whistler believed an artwork’s usefulness detracted from its aesthetic purpose. Whistler won the suit, but still ended up bankrupt.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

Impressionist pictures appear less politically charged as a result, placing emphasis on the modern leisure life. Leisure was new phenomenon on the late 19</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">century, and a by-product of capitalism; the middle class was no longer forced to work throughout the year in order to make a living.

Renoir was drawn to the mixed character of the crowd. George Riviere, a friend of Renoir’s, notes that the women in this image, whom the artist had coaxed into posing for him, were of working class origin, the type who would normally frequent such dances (Montmartre was a poor, rundown area).</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though it was partially painted on the spot, Renoir also made various preliminary studies.

Here, the brushwork helps animate the dance moment, creating a sense of the arbitrary moment. It also creates a break away from the Academic tradition: has no one focal point in the composition.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renoir was keen to present the painting as a genuine scene of Parisian life.

It was later published as a book and reached a wider audience. In it he described the squalid living conditions of the slums, where people lived without ventilation or sanitation in cramped, overcrowded rooms. He described this scene: “It was photographed by flash-light on just such a visit. In a room not thirteen feet either way slept twelve men and women, two or three in bunks set in a sort of alcove, the rest on the floor. A kerosene lamp burned dimly in the fearful atmosphere, probably to guide other and later arrivals to their ‘beds,’ for it was only just past midnight. A baby’s fretful wail came from an adjoining hall-room, where, in the semi-darkness, three recumbent figures could be made out. The ‘apartment’ was one of three in two adjoining buildings we had found, within half an hour, similarly crowded.

Flash powder was a mixture of magnesium with potassium chlorate and some antimony sulfide for added stability. Riis lit the magnesium powder on a frying pan. The process involved removing the lens cap, igniting the flash powder and replacing the lens cap; the time taken to ignite the flash powder sometimes allowed a visible image blurring created by the flash. The introduction of flash photography made it possible for Riis to photograph the darkest corners of society, like this overcrowded lodging room with no light.

In addition, large presses had been developed that made it possible to print on sizeable paper. Initially, posters were covered walls of urban buildings, but were eventually considered a uniquely modern phenomenon that poster exhibitions were held across France and posters became a collectors’ item. Posters made to advertise theatrical or musical performances, such as those by Jules Chéret were made specifically for galleries or collectors.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This poster for a performance at Folies Bergère is about the image and contains minimal text. It shows the famous American Dancer Loïe Fuller in one of her popular “serpentine” dances, dressed in billowing folds of silk that she whirled around in.

A competition was held for the design of the system’s entrances, and although Guimard never formally entered the competition, the young architect was offered the commission for his avant-garde designs, which employed mass produced cast-iron components to facilitate efficient manufacture, transportation and assembly. Additionally, the modular design of the stations enabled many dozens to be assembled in a period of only a few years.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entrance to the Porte Dauphine is one of eight entrances labelled the “Édicule B” type: simpler but still elaborate structures that consisted of three-sided glass roofed structures enclosing the stairway, with a projecting canopy.

In 1898, she joined the </span>Worpswede<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> artist colony, near Bremen, where she met and married painter Otto Modersohn. She soon grew impatient with the sentimental naturalism of the Worpswede painters and in 1900 made the first of several long trips to </span>Paris<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where she found inspiration in the works of Cézanne, Gauguin, and van Gogh.

As she sought to reinvent the representation of women in Western art history, her most radical step was in taking herself as a subject, likely becoming the </span>first modern woman artist to have painted nude and pregnant self-portraits.</div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her diaries and letters were published in 1917.</span></div></li></ol></b><br>"

Instead, they insisted upon the artistic possibilities of camera-made imagery, but held that these could be realized only when art and science had been combined to serve both truth and beauty.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Stieglitz maintained a strict “truth to materials” position, creating highly expressive images without the aid of darkroom enhancement, he was an important forerunner of so-called “straight” photography. The straight photographer exploits the intrinsic properties of the camera to make photographs that look like photographs instead of imitations of paintings or fine-art prints. This image marks his transition away from more painterly Pictorialist prints of Symbolist subjects to a more straightforward depiction of quotidian life.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He established the </span>Photo-Secession<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> group in 1902 to promote “the serious recognition of photography as an additional medium of pictorial expression.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this image, taken during a voyage to Europe, Stieglitz selected as his subject the steerage where the cheapest accommodations were. He avoids the slightest Pictorialist sentiment or anecdote, providing instead a straight document of the scene that was not merely a crowd of immigrants but a study of line, shape and light. By using photography to elevate formal qualities, engaging the same dialogues around abstraction that preoccupied European avant-garde painters, he elevated photography from a mimic of painting to a wholly formed and unique art form in itself.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four years later he published the photo on the cover of his magazine Camera Work at which point it was highly celebrated.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

Typical subjects for the group included youths, working class people, immigrant communities and the urban streets.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This painting is the third and largest of Bellow’s early prizefighting subjects. Boxing was a controversial subject at the time (public boxing matches were banned in New York State in 1900), but the interracial theme in which the black boxer appears to be winning made the painting even more so.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The painting is likely a reference to the recent and much publicized success of the African-American prizefighter Jack Johnson, who had won the world heavyweight championship in 1908. Painted at the height of the Jim Crow era, Bellows delineation of a white fighter about to be defeated by a black opponent was a provocative piece of social commentary.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Bellows’ brushstrokes underscore the violence and physicality of the match. The paint is applied with a quickness that echoes the energetic movement of the athletes. The forms, while distinct, are not delicately rendered. The obscure darkness of the background precludes any perception of recession into space, and create the feeling of a dangerous and secretive atmosphere.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bellows painting also reflects a contemporary interest in crowd psychology. He claimed, “the atmosphere around the fighters is a lot more immoral than the fighters themselves.” He exaggerates the faces of the onlookers; they grimace and shout at the drama above them. His incisive depiction of the audience reveals the influence of 19</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">century French caricaturist Honoré Daumier.&nbsp;</span></div></b>"

The woodcuts are the most dramatically </span>primitivist and expressive <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work produced by them, because of the extremes of black and white that define their space and because they recapitulate the awkwardness of medieval German woodcuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heckel used three woodblocks in the </span>puzzle technique <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invented by Munch to create this image</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">printed in green, red, and black.

It may have been his passion to express his reality in the most concrete terms possible, as an organic abstraction (or as he termed it, organic concretion) that led him from painting to collage.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The work, like his other collages, was created by tearing paper into pieces, letting them fall to the floor and pasting each scrap where it happened to land. Rather than ordering the page according to his own design, he ceded control to the random hand of gravity, thus also giving him a solution to his problems of composition with which he had been struggling.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liberated from rational thought processes, the laws of chance, Arp felt, were more in tune with the working of nature.

He served as the third and last director of the </span>Bauhaus<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Dessau from 1930 to 1933.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His work is unmistakable in its </span>clarity<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span>rigor<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with which it embodies the principles of </span>rationalism and functionalism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as in its spatial qualities, material expression and detailing. Mies had four guiding principles: the search for </span>clarity of construction<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; reduction to a </span>few formal elements<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span>simple architectural design<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; a constructional logic derived from the </span>materials<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; and the principle of simplicity and </span>continuity between indoors and outdoors<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Space for Mies was something that continues beyond its physical limits and creates connections between inside and outside.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Mies, </span>technological advances<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were a driving force of architecture, a spirit of the times that architecture should embrace and express.&nbsp; Between 1921 and 1925 he developed five visionary studies, including this </span>amoeba-like design<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Glass Skyscraper</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (1922) consisting of a core and three wings with rounded forms, which followed his radical proposal for the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Friedrichstrasse Skyscraper Project</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (1921), the first example of his </span>“skin-and-bones” architecture<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that was to dominate his later designs. Although none of the five projects were realized because they were highly </span>idealized<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they were presented in international exhibitions on modern architecture. To this day, they are regarded as remarkably innovative designs and </span>the degree zero<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of his career and of a certain strain of modern architecture.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of </span>glass<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a material for Mies is evident in this design, where the ‘window’ as a link to the surroundings and indicator of human scale was replaced by a facade of continuous glass planes that responds universally to its surroundings and became generalized as an expression of the </span>International Style<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It also reflected the more fantastic visions of </span>Expressionist<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> architects and artists, who were drawn to glass as a symbol of purity and renewal. Mies interpreted </span>transparency<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in two respects: literally, as a property of light- and air-permeable materials and figuratively, as a means of spatial arrangement in which different spaces can be seen at once.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unprecedented design is distinguished by its </span>crystalline plan, the daring use of glass<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and an </span>expressive silhouette<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that seemed to owe nothing to history. Conceived only a few years after the end of WWI, this seminal project presented a bold vision of the skyscraper as a </span>new architectural typology for the modern metropolis<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, anticipating the proliferation of the tall steel-and-glass buildings that have since become ubiquitous in cities worldwide.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A decade later Mies took part, together with Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and J.J.P. Oud, in the ‘</span>Modern Architecture’ (1932<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) </span>exhibition<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> curated by Philip Johnson and Henry-Russel Hitchcock at the </span>MoMA<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in New York, catapulting him into the limelight in the USA.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

As Fuller put it, “that is the Dymaxion principle of doing ever more with ever less weight, time, and ergs per each given level of functional performance.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 100 sqm hexagonal house (Fuller’s later versions of the designs were rounded) was an earthquake and storm resistant structure, supported by a central pole from which cables would be suspended, allowing the outer walls to be non-bearing. The Dymaxion's round shape minimized heat loss and the amount of materials needed, while also lending it strength.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By grouping all permanent utilities in the central pole, and letting the rest of the interior space remain modular, Fuller created a </span>flexible plan<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that would allow tenants to transform the space according to their needs.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Dymaxion was abandoned by Fuller until 1944, when the </span>post-War housing shortage <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">urged Fuller to revisit his previous idea of mass production of residential units. To make the house a reality, Fuller soon signed a two year research contract with Beech Aircraft industries, who held an abundance of aluminum in the aftermath of World War II. In 1946 Fuller completed two prototypes: the Barwise prototype and the Danbury prototype, though neither were assembled nor mass produced, mainly due to Fuller’s unwillingness to compromise.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fuller was accused of being overly </span>technical<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the expense of </span>aesthetic<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> merit, a charge to which he responded, \"I never work with aesthetic considerations in mind, but I have a test: if something isn't beautiful when I get finished with it, it's no good.\"</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fuller went on to teach at </span>Black Mountain College<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a nexus of modern art where students included Ruth Asawa, Elaine de Kooning, Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, Dorothea Rockburne, and Cy Twombly. Other teachers included John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and Josef and Anni Albers.</span></div></li></ol><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun fact: The Dymaxion only weighs about 3000 pounds versus the 150 tons of an average home (Fuller liked to ask people how much their house weighed), and would have cost about the same as an average car.</span></div></b>"

From 1850 to the end of the 1920s&nbsp; its population had roughly doubled every 25 years, caused by the advance of industrialisation and the end of WWI.

His work as an artist was inextricably tied to his social activism. His&nbsp; paintings, murals and posters addressed fascism, social injustice and the hardships endured by the poor working class. His works are often critical of American life, but by exposing social problems, Shahn hoped to inspire reform.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The subject of this painting was prompted by the arrest, trial and execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who were accused of murdering two men during an armed robbery in 1920. The pair’s conviction was met with widespread opposition, believed to&nbsp; have been convicted because of their political sympathies. At the time, many laborers, artists and intellectuals embraced leftist or socialist ideas and Sacco and Vanzetti were seen as symbols of the government’s suppression of political opposition.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahn followed the case closely and participated in protests in support of their release. He made 23 images about the subject, based on photographs that appeared&nbsp; in newspapers. These paintings were bitter denunciations of the American legal system, which had condemned them to death despite official doubts about their guilt.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this image, Sacco and Vanzetti lie in coffins in the foreground in front of a colonnaded neoclassical courthouse. On the porch behind them hangs a portrait of the trial judge Webster Thayer. Towering over the bodies are the members of the committee that reviewed their convictions. Shahn’s portraits are embedded in irony– Thayer raises his right hand as if taking an oath of justice, but faces a lamppost&nbsp; that resembles the bundle of sticks known as fasces, a symbol for Italian fascism and oppression in the 1920s.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The&nbsp; title of the work draws a connection to Christian martyrdom (Passion of Christ). Shahn also painted in tempera, a matte medium used by Italian Renaissance artists for Christian panel paintings. His composition invokes the images of the Lamentation of Christ but the expressions of the Committee members reveal a placid resolve rather than sorrow.</span></div></b>"

Abbott, like Mumford, was hopeful that through urban planning, Americans would be able to wrest control of their cities away from paleotechnic forces and bring about a more humane “neotechnic” era. Their ideologies are evident in her photographs from this era, composed to make the buildings look downright menacing.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The status and prestige that Abbott enjoyed in Paris did not carry over to the male-dominated field of American photography, rooted firmly in Pictorialism. She critiqued the&nbsp; works of Steichen and Steiglitz for their tendency to romanticize the American landscape, and as a result was unable to secure spaces at galleries or have her work shown at museums.</span></div></b>"

He is best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sculpture is an expression of the single most important theme of Henry Moore's art, </span>the reclining figure.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which the female form is related to landscape to create images resonant with allusions to procreation, motherhood, mother-child relationships and the relationship of all human life to the earth.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">'Four-Piece Composition' is an extreme manifestation of Moore's interest, at this time and later, in the idea of splitting the human figure into parts. It is a carving in marble comprising four separate elements positioned on a marble base. The individual elements of the sculpture do not accurately resemble human body parts, but when seen together, and in accordance with the work's title, the four pieces may be understood as individual limbs. Although they are positioned in a compact arrangement none of the four pieces of the sculpture touch each other.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore commented 'I realised what an advantage a separated two-piece composition could have in relating figures to landscape. Knees and breasts are mountains. Once these two parts become separated you don't expect it to be a naturalistic figure: therefore you can justifiably make it like a landscape or a rock.'</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four-Piece Composition demonstrates how Moore combined such seemingly opposed currents as </span>Constructivism (abstract design) and Surrealism (psychological engagement with the work<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a statement released by Unit One, the group Moore associated with, sculpture \"had two definite objects: </span>the pursuit of form (as in abstract art) and the attempt to trace the psyche (as in Surrealism)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\"</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ideological service of his work was to humanize abstraction, and to keep it within the realm of art. He also promotes a type of Surrealism in which natural analogies were favored over psychological provocations. For Moore, it was important to </span>retain nature as the primary reference for sculpture, and he avowed a truth to materials<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Four-Piece Composition he inscribed partial profiles on the surface, as if to pull the sculpture away from total abstraction towards a semi figurative reading. He looked to preclassical and primitive sources for \"a world view\" of sculpture, and in the process renewed a commitment to direct carving as an almost ethical value. By opening up the masses and creating dispersed groups he studied various kinds of space relationships in sculpture.</span></div></li></ol></b></div></b></b>"

I’ve gone back far beyond them to men like Rubens, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, a lot of the Dutch masters, Frans Hals, men like that. I gained so much in the faces, especially in the flesh tones.

Photographer Margaret Bourke-White had been dispatched to the Northwest to photograph the multimillion dollar projects of the Columbia River Basin.

Influenced by </span>Surrealism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, free association, </span>automatism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and psychoanalysis, the course included an exercise in which a canvas was placed on the ground and paint was thrown on it directly from the cans of paint, which had had a hole poked into them. This was, for Siqueiros, a first step of artistic creation, in which the artist had to engage with the work using his entire body. He called this the \"controlled accident\" in painting.

Back in New York, she established a gallery called “Art of This Century” where she exhibited and sold work by the surrealists alongside work by Americans, exposing American audiences to European avant-garde movements, and providing a venue for American artist to thrive alongside the more established European modernists. For her 1942 exhibition she commissioned Kiesler to build a specially designed curved space in which to exhibit the work.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiesler was a young associate of the De Stijl group who had become known for his avant-garde theater designs</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For “Art of This Century” he divided the exhibition into four spaces, one for temporary shows and three for fixed exhibitions of the collection.

Bouncing against&nbsp; each other, the tiny blinking blocks of color create a vital and pulsing rhythm, an optical vibration that jumps between intersections evoking traffic on the streets of New York.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In New York, Mondrian devised a method of composing with commercially available colored tapes that he could easily shift around until he was satisfied with the composition to commit to paint the&nbsp; canvas.

In Spain he fought on the side of the Republicans during the Civil War, a fact that endeared him to Picasso when he moved to Paris. Lam spent eighteen years in Europe (1923-41), which deeply affected his artistic vision. While there, he befriended Picasso and also established himself as an integral member of the Surrealist movement. He explored imagery that was heavily influenced by Picasso, Cubism, and African art. Lam left Paris because of World War II, eventually traveling with Breton to Martinique, where they were joined by Masson.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artistic and cultural traditions of Lam's homeland and Europe converged when he returned to Cuba and renewed his familiarity with its light, vegetation, and culture. In The Jungle the presence of the woman-horse, who in Afro-Cuban mysticism refers to a spirit in communication with the natural world, mirrors Lam's own confrontational dialogue with the so-called primitive interests expressed in advanced European painting. His work is an example of this confluence of two cultures.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lam painted The Jungle, his masterpiece, two years after returning to his native Cuba from Europe, where he had been a member of the Surrealist movement. The work, \"intended to communicate a psychic state,\" Lam said, depicts a group of figures with crescentshaped faces that recall African or Pacific Islander masks, against a background of vertical, striated poles suggesting Cuban sugarcane fields. Together these elements obliquely address the history of slavery in colonial Cuba.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this monumental and thematically complex gouache, masked figures simultaneously appear and disappear amid the thick foliage of sugarcane and bamboo. The multiperspectival rendering of these figures mirrors Cubist vocabulary, while the fantastical moonlit scene around these monstrous beings—half man, half animal—emerging out of a primeval jungle evokes the realm of the Surrealists. In his desire to express the spirit of Afro-Cuban culture, in particular that of the uprooted Africans \"who brought their primitive culture, their magical religion, with its mystical side in close correspondence with nature,\" Lam reinforces the Surrealist aspect of this work</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based in part on the Cuban religion of Santería, which blends mystical and ritualistic traditions from Africa with old-world Catholicism, The Jungle presents a dense tropical landscape populated by odd, long-limbed creatures whose disjointed heads resemble African masks. These human-animal hybrids,who assemble in a lush dreamscape, give evidence of the artist's Surrealist background.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lam returned to France in 1952, though he continued to travel widely and visit Cuba.

His work was seen as indicative of an American self-reliance and independence. His paintings of the mid-1940s, usually involving some degree of figuration, were coarse and heavy, but filled&nbsp; with a nervous, brutal energy all of their own.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. &nbsp; The&nbsp; landscapes of Ryder as well as the work of Mexican muralists were important sources for Pollock’s violently expressive early paintings, as were methods of Míro. In 1939, MoMA mounted a large Picasso exhibition, which was a catalyst for Abstract Expressionists like Pollock to learn from his example and forge their own independent styles out of Cubism.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. &nbsp; Like other members of the New York School, Pollock was influenced in his early work by the Surrealists’ concept of the unconscious. In the late 1930s, he introduced imagery based on totemic or mythic figures, ideographic signs, and ritualistic events, which have been interpreted as pertaining to the buried experiences and cultural memories of the psyche.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. &nbsp; The imagery of this work is considered to have been influenced by ritual Navajo sand painting and references a Native American myth. Against the backdrop of a blue sky, a woman with a crown of feathers wields a knife, attempting to slash the moon. The blue background is overshadowed by red splashes, indicating a domination of violence and bloodshed in the modern world.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. &nbsp; Carl Jung’s theories of the collective unconscious as a repository for ancient myths and universal archetypes were a frequent topic of discussion in Abstract Expressionist circles. Pollock underwent psychoanalysis with Jungian analysts beginning in 1939. The psychic content of his early works have therefore been interpreted through Jungian themes.&nbsp;</span></div></b><br>"

The eastern staircase is formal and rectilinear, with two flights carved from impeccably hewn granite. The western staircase has a more irregular footprint, and is made not of stone or brick but of terraced sod held back by wooden planks.

The broken, tilted rooflines similarly seem to move and merge with the natural environment</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was important to Aalto that the design represent democracy and the people's relationship with the government which is why he included a large public space, along with sections dedicated to the public</span></div></li></ol></b>"

He lived in New York and was close with Stuart Davis, Gorky, and John Graham (with whom he frequently visited the Met).&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeKooning trained in both </span>fine and commercial art <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at the Rotterdam Academy in The Netherlands and worked as a sign painter, while making his early paintings and drawings in a more academic style. As a part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s </span>Works Progress Administration<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (WPA) program, designed to relieve rising unemployment, de Kooning was commissioned to design public murals. His studies for the murals were never realized, but they were among his first abstractions. His experience working on this project spurred him to pursue art making full-time.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">De Kooning taught painting at </span>Black Mountain College<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the summer of 1948, and was accompanied Elaine de Kooning (his wife). He influenced and nurtured the careers of following generations of artists, including </span>Robert Rauschenberg<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. de Kooning gave Rauschenberg the work that he used for his </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Erased de Kooning, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">albeit somewhat reluctantly. (This was a drawing from the Woman series, at Rauschenberg’s request.

And it's impossible not to.\"</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">De Kooning said that his images of women referenced “the </span>female painted through all the ages,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> all those idols.” De Kooning once summarized the history of representations of women as “the idol, the Venus, the nude.” He emphasized the </span>dual nature of the sexual identity<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of his </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Woman </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">paintings, claiming that they derived partially from the feminine within himself.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He labored over the giant oil-on-canvas </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Woman I </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for 18 months, scraping it down and </span>revising<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it, and making many drawings on the subject. De Kooning chose to abandon Woman I early in 1952, and only resumed work on the painting after art historian Meyer Schapiro offered words of encouragement about the abandoned canvas during a visit with the artist at his Fourth Avenue studio (in what critic Peter Schjeldahl has termed ‘history’s luckiest studio visit’). This painting, and others in its series, went on show in New York later that year.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of critics hated de Kooning’s paintings of women when they were first shown in New York, seeing them as misogynist and violent.

American </span>popular culture<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was embraced as a liberating, egalitarian force by a new generation less interested in “</span>high culture<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” (which encompassed modernist abstraction and aristocratic classicism). Late in 1952 the Smithsons met with critic Lawrence Alloway, artist </span>Richard Hamilton<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi, architectural historian Reyner Banham and others met in London at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. They called themselves the </span>Independent Group<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and were interested in contemporary mass culture and its implications and manifestations, including Western movies, science fiction, billboards, and machines. (Alloway would later be the first to use the term</span> Pop Art<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in print in 1958.)</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Smithsons would later write in 1956 that “</span>mass production<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is establishing our whole pattern of life--principles, morals, aims, aspirations, and standard of living. We must somehow get the measure of this intervention if we are to match its powerful and exciting impulses with our own.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Smithsons’ interest in mass culture and machines extended to architectural materials in their design practice: their competition entry for the reconstruction of post-war ruins in London (Golden Lane) was a bold vision made from concrete, rather than the staid materials of wood and stone. These designs were a </span>new Brutalism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (a term initially used to describe Le Corbusier’s use of beton brut: raw concrete). The Smithsons reflected in 1957 that “Brutalism tries to face up to a </span>mass-production society<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and drag a rough poetry out of the confused and powerful forces which are at work”--it was “a confronting of what the </span>postwar world<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was actually like.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were interested in </span>truth to materials<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - as they put it, “we were concerned with the seeing of materials for what they were : the woodness of wood, the sandiness of sand. With this came a </span>distaste of the simulated<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">...We worked with a belief in the gradual revealing by a building-in-formation of its own rules for its required form...The image was discovered within the process of making the work.” Their style was often referred to as a “</span>warehouse aesthetic<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”--like the Bauhaus, they </span>eschewed ornamentation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and further, kept </span>finishes at a minimum<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (This ran contrary to the Neo-Palladian architecture popular in postwar Britain.)</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Smithsons’ proposal for Golden Lane presupposed a complex urban structure with a </span>high density<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of people: dwelling units, public space, circulation, articulated into a pattern of mobility and identity.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The structuring of Golden Lane aimed to, according to the Smithsons, “create a true street-in-the-air, each ‘street’ having a large number of people dependent on it for access.” These proposed streets-in-the-air would separate pedestrian traffic from motorways (in part a response to the </span>rise of the automobile<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), and create a sense of </span>community<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Unlike galleries of the 1930s, which were rather pragmatic and narrow, streets-in-the-sky were created for public enjoyment, “wide enough for two mothers with prams to stop and talk and still leave room to pass” (Smithson and Smithson 1967, 25).&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Smithsons’ approach was intended to be </span>flexible and adaptable<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a rejection of the </span>modernist grid<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The designs were a response to and rejection of the rigid structure of </span>Le Corbusier’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Unite d’Habitation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and sought to respond to the social needs of urban dwellers. For example, the number of bedrooms and layout were somewhat flexible, with a garden for each unit opening onto one of the streets-in-the-sky. One could add extra bedrooms, a workshop, or simply retain the garden as a large outdoor space.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

He portrayed his figures as violently distorted, imprisoned and isolated souls tormented by existential dilemmas.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His early paintings are highly painterly however, compose of rich and vibrant colors that glow from the canvas in a chiaroscuro effect. In this way they are simultaneously horrifying and beautiful, enthralling and repulsive. In this image as in many of his other paintings, he depicts shadows or voids (e.g. the background and the figure’s mouth) in a thick black paint that is almost suffocating in its heaviness and in places seems thicker than the blurred and translucent figures.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this painting, bacon takes as his starting point Velázquez’s portrait of Pope Innocent from 1650 from which he made a series of painting beginning in 1949. While maintaining a similar composition that allows for the influence of Velázquez’s image to be detected, Bacon transforms the portrait of realism that capture’s the pope’s aging stature, intelligence and control into one of vulnerability, anxiety, confinement and disintergration. He transforms the Pope’s throne into a sort of golden cage and blurs the figure’s face as if behind a veil so that all one can properly identify is the black hole of his open screaming mouth.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bacon sought to make the best painting of the human cry, and in this image combined the portrait of Pop Innocent with a famous still from the Russian film </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">The Battleship Potemkin </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(1925) by Sergei Eisenstein of a woman screaming with blood pouring from her eye.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exact meaning of Bacon’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Pope, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and whether or not it was intended to be a political statement,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is deliberately obscured by the artist. While some critics have interpreted the Pope series as a Nietzschean declaration of “God is dead,” and others as a symbolic killing of a father figure, Bacon rejected such literal interpretations instead describing the work as his attempt to triumph over Velázquez.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bacon avoided ever seeing Velázquez’s painting in person, so his references are all pulled from books, allowing him to maintain his characteristic distance from his subject.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One can easily identify the influence of surrealism and German expressionism, but in his paintings the British Bacon established a completely distinct personal style.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

Both movements shared a need to reject geometric abstraction and create a spontaneous art guided by emotion and intuition. Art Informel was a term devised by the French critic Michel Tapié in 1950 to describe this type of expression. Although most often associated with Art Informel, Soulages opposed this label, holding that his use of geometry runs counter to the works of other Art Informel artists like Jean Dubuffet and Henri Michaux.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soulages settled in Paris in 1946, when he arrived at his signature style by crafting assertive abstract forms based on studies of trees. In his early work, he took leafless winter trees as his point of departure. Their essential, reduced network of branches provided him with an ideal vehicle for the exploration of structure and variation.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"color: rgb(43, 41, 43); font-weight: 400;\">By the mid 1950s, Soulages had switched from a small brush, with which he had painted abstract calligraphic patterns, to palette knives, straightedges, and large house-painting brushes. These tools afforded him a greater range of motion in his wrist, allowing him to produce bold, dynamic strokes that resulted in a more gestural surface. He roughly applied volumes of predominantly black paint on a white ground in broad, slab-like strokes, thereby imparting to his paintings both an architectonic and a sculptural quality.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"color: rgb(43, 41, 43); font-weight: 400;\">He was influenced by Romanesque sculpture and architecture, as well as the ancient Gallic stone dolmens (prehistoric stone monuments made of large stones forming two upright posts supporting a lintel) that punctuated the land around his childhood home in southern France.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He consistently maintained a subdued palette, expressing that “the more limited the means, the stronger the expression.” His great sweeping lines or color areas are usually black or of a dark color.

(Vantablack avant la lettre.) Klein saw the blue as embodying unity, serenity - the greatest “representation of the </span>immaterial<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the sovereign liberation of the spirit.”The announcement card for his one-man exhibition at the Galleria Apollinaire, Milan, in 1957 described IKB as 'a Blue in itself, disengaged from all functional justification' (quoted in Stich, p.81).&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By this time Klein had arrived at a means of painting in which the incandescence of IKB could be maximised. First he stretched his canvas or cotton scrim over a wooden backing, which had been treated with the milk protein casein. This assisted the adherence of the paint when it was applied with a roller. Then he applied an </span>industrial blue paint<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, similar to gouache, which he mixed with a highly volatile fixative. When the paint dried the pigment appeared to hover over the surface of the canvas creating a rich velvety texture and an unusual appearance of depth.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klein’s works from this series were a radical alternative to </span>Abstract Expressionism’s<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fetishization of the gesture: no trace of Klein’s hand was visible on the later canvases in this series, once he perfected his technique.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span>New Realist<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> movement was officially founded in Klein’s Paris apartment in 1960 by critic Pierre Restany; the original group included Klein, Martial Raysse, Arman, </span>Jean Tinguely<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Daniel Spoerri, Raymond Hains, Jacques de la Villeglé, and François Dufrêne. Restany wrote in 1962, “contemporary nature is mechanical, industrial and flooded with advertisements...The reality of everyday life has now become the factory and the city. Born under the twin signs of </span>standardization and efficiency,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> extroversion is the rule of the new world.” Klein’s monochromes - in the later of which the </span>hand of the artist was invisible<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - are an apt fit for such a moment. (Arnason rather snarkily notes that the price was one of the only ways to differentiate Klein’s monochromes.)</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding the difference between his own work and </span>Kasimir Malevich’s<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Klein wrote (c. 1960): “Malevitch [sic] painted a still life of one of my monochrome paintings. Malevitch [sic] had, in effect, </span>infinity<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before him - me, I ‘am’ inside of it - one does not represent the infinite or produce it…”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klein did not give titles to his monochromes but after his death in 1962, his widow Rotraut Klein-Moquay numbered all the known blue monochromes IKB 1 to IKB 194, a sequence which did not reflect their chronological order.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not including the Anthropometries here...but if you’re curious: </span><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 0, 204); font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/yves-klein-1418/yves-klein-anthropometries\">https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/yves-klein-1418/yves-klein-anthropometries</a></span></div></li></ol><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun fact: Klein was a Rosicrucian!!!!

Initially, like </span>Lichtenstein<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he made paintings based on popular comic strips, but he soon began to concentrate on the subjects derived from advertising and commercial products for which he is best known: Coca-Cola bottles, Campbell’s soup cans, Brillo cartons.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From these consumer products he turned to the examination of contemporary American folk heroes and glamorous movie stars.

The grid functions like a program that the artist uses to “automate” the process of composing the work, instead of relying on subjective thoughts or feelings to make decisions (compare </span>Dada <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or </span>Surrealism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).

But he castigated this as \"extract art,\" having nothing to do with real abstraction, which, he said, \"cannot be 'used' in education, communication, perception, foreign relations, etc.\" It was for this reason that Reinhardt truly wanted a \"new academy,\" which would function like those of the seventeenth century: protecting a notion of aesthetic purity and maintaining the difference between high art and its applied derivatives. Such an academy would make clear, he said, that art is essentially \"'out of time,' art made fine, art emptied and purified of all other- than-art meanings.\"</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His own attempt to purify abstraction took the form of marrying the two major paradigms of abstraction: the grid and the monochrome. In the black paintings, Reinhardt approaches the unbroken surface of monochrome painting, which eliminates the possibility of distinguishing any figure from ground.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the monochrome surface, one can eventually make out a barely perceptible grid, created by strokes of a slightly different shade of black. In pairing the monochrome with the grid, he guarantees the self-referentiality of the work – they describe nothing but the surface of the work itself (similar to </span>Stella’s <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">positivism)</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reinhardt like many abstract artists sought a timelessness in his work. There was a sense of a progression toward the ultimate, or purist version of painting in abstraction, the creation of the “last work of its time,” that propelled Mondrian, for example to an ever purer sublation of oppositions. With the Black paintings Reinhardt said: \"I'm merely making the last paintings which anyone can make.\"&nbsp; (lol)</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Reinhardt applied his colors with brushes, he did so without leaving the slightest trace of his implement on the surface.

This painting is based on one of those images, transforming the mundane motif into a dramatically foreshortened composition, slicing the canvas diagonally, turning the sky black, and rendering the station a sleek, gleaming structure that recalls Precisionist paintings of the 1930s. In monumentalizing the gas station he turns it into a symbol of American vernacular landscape.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruscha was trained as a commercial illustrator and in his move to “fine art” explained that he wanted “absolutely neutral material.” He said that “My pictures are not that interesting, nor the subject matter.

In this way the originally imagery becomes further detached from its place in the landscape, serving as a flat and immediately recognizable symbol, much like Jasper Johns’s Flags in their various iterations.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we would classify Ruscha under Pop Art for his elevation of mass culture to cross-pollinate with fine art, and interest in the vernacular, his early work anticipated Conceptual art of the 1970s in its interest in systems of information and semiotics.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

In the first of these grids, she used colored pencils but by 1964, she had switched to simple graphite so that monochromatism took over these pictures, which were nonetheless, were able to achieve an extraordinary visual variety.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because she endowed that variety with titles evocative of the natural world, and because of the strong impression of effulgence generated by the gridded fields, as if emanating indefinable lights, Martin’s paintings were seen as analogues of nature.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her work began to be read along the lines of thematized abstract art, that insisted on interpreting even the starkest grid or most ascetic monochrome phenomenologically, in iconographic terms associated the Sublime.

In this sense, her compositions are not involved in picturing anything specific, as clouds, sky, light or sublime immensity. Instead, she generates a structural paradigm in which atmosphere becomes less a question of intuition and more a unit in a system. This makes a reductive reading of Martin’s work as “pure spatial immensity” or “pure spirit” impossible.</span></div></b>"

Also derived from Greenberg was the attention paid to the environment in which an artwork was installed, which would become central to Minimalism</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Flavin’s works the glass tubes of fluorescent light functions as a sculpture both when illuminated and when unlit, creating different effects. In turn he recognized that light itself could transform and environment</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flavin, along with young sculptors in the 60s such as Judd and Andre sought to find a “great alternative to the semi-Surrealist work of the fifties such as Giacometti’s and the late Cubism of David Smith,” and found it in the Constructivism of Tatlin and Rodchenko. This ultimately trumped the model of a medium-specific modernism advanced by Greenberg.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flavin was drawn to Tatlin for his demonstration of industrial material, exposed production, and architectural siting. Furthermore Flavin, like Tatlin, was interested in the Byzantine icon which carried with it a “physical feeling” and “magical presiding presence” that impressed him. The icon provided Flavin with an alternative model of the picture, one which was assertively material but also spectrally spiritual. In this work Flavin pays homage to Tatlin in a pyramid of fluorescent lights that recalls the proposal spiral of metalwork of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Monument to the Third International.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But unlike Constructivism, Flavin’s industrial material here was not futuristic but found precisely in the readymade. Flavin regarded his light as “a modern technological fetish.” In this way he held together two contradictory imperatives of modernist art: the imperative to materialize the work of art, declare light as light and expose its physical support, and also to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">de</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">materialize the work, to irradiate it with light, to wash space with color.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

Since its meaning is not predetermined, the real work of the piece lies ahead, in the encounter with the viewer, when it is exposed to the world. The vision it offers us is a moment in world history, yet it is </span>an unnamed moment<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dates on the paintings, hand-painted with calculated precision, are always centered on the canvas and painted white, whereas the background colors vary.

Some days he made more than one. When Kawara was unable to complete the painting on the day it was started he immediately destroyed it.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a Date Painting is not exhibited, it is placed in a cardboard box custom-made for the painting, which is lined with a </span>clipping from a local newspaper from the city in which the artist made the painting<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; most clippings are from The New York Times. Although the boxes are part of the work, they are rarely exhibited.

When Kawara finished a painting, he applied a swatch of the paint mixture he used to a small rectangle that was then glued onto a chart in the journal. The 48 journals record the details of the painting's size, color and newspaper headline, while the calendar uses colored dots to indicate the days in which a painting was made, and to record the number of days since the artist's birth. Kawara created nearly 3,000 date paintings in more than 112 cities worldwide in a project that was planned to end only with his death.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The significance of these paintings lies in the fact that they depict not only a date, but also </span>their own date<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If, historically, paintings have been fixed in time by a date on the front or back of the canvas, the date itself for Kawara becomes the subject of the painting and the sole embodiment of the work's figurative imagery.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kawara made the passage of time itself the all-important subject by each day starting a small black painting that simply set forth the current date in white block letters.

Upon Kimbell’s death, his estate was bequeathed to the foundation with the intentions of building a new museum. The foundation director Richard Brown set clear guidelines regarding the new building as a work of art. He interviewed several architects including Mies Van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer, but the commission was awarded to Kahn in 1966.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American architect Louis Kahn’s work emerged amidst the uncertainty and loss of idealism of the 1930s and 40s. Born in&nbsp; Estonia, Khan emigrated with his family to Philadelphia in 1905. He received architectural training in the Beaux Arts tradition at the University of Pennsylvania. His&nbsp; later work reflected a fusion of modernism’s passion for technology and abstract form along with a profound awareness of history and its role in architecture.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas is considered one of the most dramatic as well functionally effective art museums in the world. The design is based upon a parallel series of self-supporting cycloidal vaults that eliminate the need for interior supports and facilitate and unobstructed and very flexible use of the spacious interior.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interior and outdoor spaces are integration through the inclusion of a sculpture garden that creates a fluid interchange between the museum and its environment, thereby altering the traditional notion of a museum as a place that cloisters works of art.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kahn is also noted for the close attention paid to the issues of lighting and display. By combining natural and artificial light, and breaking up the cavernous heights of the gallery space by low hanging lights and shorter partitioning walls, the Kimbell becomes both a practical space for the display and conservation of art and an aesthetically pleasing environment that is simultaneously monumental and intimate for the gallery visitors.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his guidelines, Brown emphasised that “natural light should play a vital part” in the design. The distinct form of the Kimbell Museum’s cycloid barrel vaults are rimmed with narrow plexiglass skylights, providing room for natural light to penetrate into the spaces. To diffuse this light, pierced aluminium reflectors shaped like wings hang below, illuminating the smooth surfaces of the concrete while providing elegant light conditions for the artworks.</span></div></b>"

That is, a notebook entry about painting could replace the painting. And visual data less as pleasing artistically than as documentation, as in a store catalogue or police photograph […] Important was that I was the strategist. Someone else built and primed the canvases and took them to the sign painter, the texts are quotations from art books and the sign painter was instructed not to attempt to make attractive artful lettering but to letter the information in the most simple way.”</span></div></li></ol></b>"

It was in the early 1960s when she began to shape plaster, latex and fabric in ways that evoked abstract body parts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. &nbsp; &nbsp; Bourgeois gave another twist to the surrealist object, in this case the sexual fetish in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">La Fillette </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Litte Girl). A dirty, penile object in latex over plaster, this work is a “disagreeable object” (a term used by Giacometti). By using&nbsp; the materiality of latex, she achieves a fleshy, tactile texture in the sculpture</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. &nbsp; &nbsp; According to Freud, women might associate penis and baby in order to compensate the lack of the first with the gain of the second. But this “little girl” is represented not as a fetish object or penis substitute but a personage in her own right. In this regard, the work is a bold gesture: as a feminist appropriation of the symbolic phallus.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a work fraught with ambivalence. When hung by a wire, as it is often displayed, it appears as an object of hate, a castrated piece of meat. But when cradled, as it is by Bourgeois in a well-known photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe. Whether lovingly cradled or brutally dangled, the contrary nature of the work epitomizes Bourgeois’s intense and mixed feelings towards mother&nbsp; hood, masculinity and sexuality.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. &nbsp; &nbsp; While there is much in her work that refers to her troubled relationship with her philandering father, as a wife and mother of three sons, Bourgeois also viewed masculinity as something more vulnerable; she says, “The phallus is a subject of my tenderness. Everything I loved had the shape of the people around me– the shape of my husband, the shape of the children. So, when I wanted to represent something I loved, I obviously represented a little penis.”&nbsp;</span></div></b>"

Like </span>Andy Warhol<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hanson saw </span>boredom and banality<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as key characteristics of post-war, consumer society (although the bored affect is perhaps a modern rather than postwar condition - see </span>Neue Sachlichkeit<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This work is Polyester resin and fibreglass, painted in oil, and mixed media.

Their clothing marks them as temporally-specific, rooted in the 1970s.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of their materiality the figures are somewhat reminiscent of mannequins (we might think of the Dada and Surrealist fascination with mannequins, and Atget’s photographs of shop windows.) Rather than the idealized bodies of most mannequins, however, these figures have the lumps and bumps of real people.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although these two figures are presented as a couple, they were cast from life, one after the other, and never met.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building on the legacy of Minimalism, which shared a real space with the viewer, these works have no clear delineation between viewer and artwork.

Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the </span>hyperreal<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and of simulation.

This piece was also constructed from television picture tubes encased in Plexiglas boxes, and its screens were meant to show broadcast TV, prerecorded tape, or live, closed-circuit images, all of which could be manipulated by Moorman. But TV Cello, a proxy for Moorman’s traditional cello, </span>was also a functioning musical instrument.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Moorman, it was “the first advance in cello design since 1600.” It had strings, tuning pegs, a bridge and tailpiece, and even a rudimentary peg, just like a standard cello. The strings, however, were amplified and </span>produced crashing electronic sounds when she played it<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the 1970s, Moorman performed with TV Bra and TV Cello dozens of times, in venues ranging from museums and galleries to shopping malls and community centers. Both objects perfectly melded her brilliance as a performer with Paik’s artistic goal to “humanize technology.” They are also singular works in the history of interdisciplinary art: </span>unprecedented fusions of sculpture, moving image, live performance, sound, and popular culture that blurred the lines between Moorman’s body and Paik’s artwork.</div></li></ol><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What’s happening?

Along the way he expresses his ideas about time, movement, and place by making small marks on the earth, e.g. “suck[ing] icicles from the grass stems.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This work records a walk he made on Dartmoor during New Year 1971-2, repeatedly following a&nbsp; pre-determined circular route that he sketched out on the presented map. In the work he records his experience of sounds heard on the walk, how he became away of the presence of rivers as he approached them, pockets of sounds in gullies, and how the sound disappeared behind him as he walked on. The work incorporates both the internal feelings and thoughts of the artist and the external aspects of his experience.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Corrina, Corrina” is a reference to a song by Bob Dylan. The photograph below the text was taken during the walk, looking forward in the direction Long was walking.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These works seem indebted to the instructional work of the Fluxus artists, in that the final texts works document, or perhaps even guide the action the artist’s take (unclear if he writes the text before or after doing the walk). It therefore is unclear whether the walk itself is the artwork or the text representing it is. In much of his work with the land, he broadened the idea of sculpture, photography, etc. to be a part of performance art and conceptual art.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also engages with the popular land art movement of the 1970s in which sculptors were altering or manipulating the land as artworks. Long’s work is one of the less invasive forms of land art of this group, and is far more aligned with conceptualism than that of Smithson, de Maria or Heizer.

The Pompidou takes the Bauhaus pragmatism and technology as its point of departure, only to transform them into a surreal dream of pipes and trusses, marine funnels and vents, most of which festoon the exoskeleton.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their design portrayed the museum itself as a movement. The skeleton engulfs the building from its exterior, showing all the different mechanical and structural systems, not only so they could be understood but also to maximise the interior space without interruptions. The different systems on the exterior are painted in different colors to distinguish their different roles.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its time, the design achieved a new standard in open-space flexibility.

At a moment when the role of the artist as curator had relatively few precedents, the Belgian poet-turned-artist took that possibility even further, transforming himself into the artist as curator, administrator, press agent, and museum director, all in one. He created a convincing fiction, whereby he </span>mimicked institutional approaches<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the creation of no less than 12 “sections” for his ambitious museum. The first of these (Section XIXème siecle) exhibited materials used to stage museum and gallery exhibitions (eg, lamps, ladders, crates, signage)</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1972, Kunsthalle Düsseldorf director Karl Ruhrberg, together with junior curator Jürgen Harten, invited Broodthaers to install a section of the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Musée</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the Kunsthalle, which resulted in the creation of the “Section des Figures” (Figure Section), seen here. It was the largest and most spectacular of the sections.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artist presented more than 300 artworks from all eras and geographies including a number of new commissions (by artists including by </span>Gerhard Richter<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), originating from some 50 museums and other collections, alongside a plenitude of vernacular objects and reproductions. All bore an image of the eagle (l’aigle), totaling some 500 “figures” of eagles in all.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broodthaers listed the eagle’s attributes as “Greatness, authority, power. Divine spirit. Spirit of conquest. Imperialism.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As other </span>Conceptual artists<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were rejecting the </span>iconographic<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a relic and seeking to transcend the </span>historical strictures<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> imposed by the museum and academy, Broodthaers reintroduced the taxonomic features and discursive formations that the museum represented as a mode of critiquing Conceptualism. Conceptualism had not, he seemed to argue, succeeded in establishing a truly egalitarian artform: Broodthaers exposed this as a typically avant-garde myth, pointing to the survival of the </span>systems of classification and valuation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Conceptualism sought to discard.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broodthaers’ project, Buchloh argues, was an </span>antimodernist<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, conservative blague (joke): a reactionary response reasserting the </span>contiguity of the present with the past<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (rather than treating the present as a rupture or break.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

The Man Who Flew into Space from His Apartment tells the story of one of the residents who built a catapult-like contraption to shoot himself through the roof into outer space, where he would travel on powerful streams of energy. A text describes the story as narrated by three of the other residents, one of whom happened to know the cosmonaut better than the others yet admits, “I didn’t know him well.” The room still contains the contraption, a gaping hole in the ceiling, and scientific drawings and diagrams tacked to a wall that is covered with wallpaper composed of old Soviet propaganda posters along with debris left behind (broken dishes, simple furniture and clothing). A diorama of the town shows the man’s expected projectile path into outer space. The text explains that shortly after the man went into orbit authorities arrived and boarded up the room.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The work also raises questions of authorship in modernity. All of Kabakov's work is made in the name of other, fictitious artists. This reveals a hidden rule of the modern art system: only an artist who doesn't want to be an artist or who doesn't even know that he is an artist is a real artist—just as only an artwork that does not look like an artwork is a real artwork. The installation is a narrative, the documentation of a fictitious event.</span></div></li></ol></b>"

When you see it, you're not horrified by it at all, but what it represents is the crucifixion of a man.

At a meeting of the US Senate the following May, Republican senator Jesse Helms said this of Serrano and his work: 'Mr President [George Bush, Sr.], he is not an artist. He is a jerk.

Writers on the post-1968 student movement and the events leading to the formation of the Baader-Meinhof Group had made it clear that this rebellion against the neocapitalist German state was triggered largely by an underlying horror at both the complicity of the postwar generation's participation in the history of Nazi Germany and its insistent refusal to acknowledge this complicity</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this work, Richter employs his signature technique of wiping across the still-wet surface of his photo-paintings with a squeegee to soften the edges and blur the image.

Finding that a strictly abstract style was not suited to the stories he wanted to tell, Ligon has excerpted texts by Zora Neal Hurston, Walt Whitman, Jean Genet, Gertrude Stein, James Baldwin, Richard Pryor, and Ralph Ellison among others in his works.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ligon encourages the streaks left behind by oil sticks and stencils to progressively obscure the text on his canvases, experimenting with the subject of </span>legibility and erasure<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, particularly as they relate to race, and the </span>limits of signs<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He explains, “Oil paint wants to spread out and smudge and smear. And after about six months of trying to make perfect letters, I realized that the smudging and smearing and disappearance of the letters was way more interesting than trying to make a perfect letter form. And so the paintings became about that disappearance of language.” (c.f. </span>material specificity<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) As Ligon worked his way down the support, the text became progressively smudged and illegible because the greasy oil stick left a residue that adhered to the stencil. “The smearing also creates a visual interaction with the gesso ground, a metaphor for the interaction between blacks and whites in the </span>construction of racial identity<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” Ligon has said.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This oilstick-on-canvas work features an excerpt from Zora Neale Hurston’s 1928 essay “How It Feels to Be Colored Me,” in which the author describes leaving the protective black community of her childhood at age thirteen and suddenly being confronted with the issue of race - being a Black person in a white society.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describing what drew him to this text, Ligon has said: “I became really fascinated by those sentences that had the word ‘I’ in them—‘I feel most colored when I'm thrown against a sharp white background.’ The use of the word ‘I’ creates a kind of confusion. Is it the ‘I’ of the text that I'm quoting, or is it ‘I,’ Glenn Ligon, feel most colored? And so, the confusion between those two things was something I was interested in.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1989, Ligon’s first solo show, \"How It Feels to Be Colored Me,\" opened in Brooklyn. The exhibition established his reputation for making works like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Untitled, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in which the same phrase is repeated, growing increasingly obscured as it moves down the support.&nbsp;</span></div></li></ol><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Fact: Notes on the Margin of the Black Book is Ligon’s response to Mapplethorpe’s Black Book, a series of highly eroticized photographs of mostly-nude Black men: </span><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 0, 204); font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/10382\">https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/10382</a></span></div></b>"

(The title is ambiguous - it might refer to the subject of the painting specifically, or to the archetypal figure of the painter.) Many writers identify the red paint on the child’s left hand with blood. The perceived threat of the image is bolstered by the painting’s monumental scale (over 6’ tall) and the child’s shadowed eyes.

In the same way as people can die anywhere. Most people don’t die in the middle of a square or on a beautiful boulevard; their deaths rarely happen in a strategic location, even famous people don’t die in « the center ». There is no hierarchy of location between anonymous and famous people. There are unexpected locations. The location is important not in relationship to the layout of the city, but in relation to the people who died. This gives me the plan for locating the altars. These altars are questioning the status of a monument today by </span>their form, by their location, and by their duration<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Thus, the choice of location is determining for my statement on work in public space and my critique of monuments.The forms of these homages are alike, whether made for celebrities or made for the unknown: candles, flowers, often wrapped in transparent paper, teddy bears and stuffed animals, written messages on scraps of paper with hearts and other love symbols. With this wild mixture of forms, the messages of love and attachment to the deceased person are expressed without any aesthetic concern; it is this personal commitment that interests me.</span> It comes from the heart. It is pure energy. One is not preoccupied with the form-quality of the elements, but only with the message that is to be conveyed.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The forms of these altars, that are profane and not religious, convey a visual form based on weakness. The forms and locations of the altars show the precarious aspect of the work. It is because of necessity and urgency that they are there. The cruelty and the non-spectacular of these monuments makes them untouchable by people walking by, proprietors, street-cleaners, dog-walkers, policemen. Everyone could be concerned. Everyone is concerned. These altars will disappear sooner or later. The average duration of the altars is of two weeks. The disappearance of the altar is as important as its presence. The memory of what is important doesn’t need a monument.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such works, which exist s</span>omewhere between a public installation an obscure performance, and a private archive<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, can also be found in nonart spaces, which might render them even more difficult to decipher in aesthetic terms; nonetheless, they can be taken to indicate a distinctive turn in recent art.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They draw on a wide range of artistic precedents such as the performative objects of Fluxus, the humble materials of Arte Povera, and the site-specific strategies of institution-critical artists like Marcel Broodthaers, Michael Asher, and Hans Haacke. </span>Yet the current generation has also transformed the familiar devices of the readymade collaboration, and installation.</div></li></ol></b>"

Together, these dictate the building's distinctive faceted shape.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The library’s striking appearance consists of discrete \"floating platforms\" seemingly wrapped in a </span>large steel net around glass skin<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, unifying the programmatic clusters on the platforms and in the interstitial spaces.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From OMA’s website: “OMA's ambition is to redefine the library as an institution no longer exclusively dedicated to the book, but rather as an </span>information store<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where all potent forms of media – new and old – are presented equally and legibly. In an age in which information can be accessed anywhere, it is the simultaneity of media and (more importantly) the curatorship of its contents that will make the library vital.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mixing Chamber, on the third floor, is an area of librarian-patron interaction – a trading floor for information orchestrated to fulfill an essential (though often neglected) need for expert interdisciplinary help. Librarians guide readers up into the four-story Books Spiral, a continuous ramp of shelving with sections designed to be flexible and to expand as the library’s holdings grow. This designing of spaces to </span>facilitate interraction<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span>anticipate shifting future needs<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is typical of OMA’s approach to design.</span></div></li></ol></b>"
