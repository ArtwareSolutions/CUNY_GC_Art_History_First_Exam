It was was such a success that Louis kept the original and sent him a copy instead. The original became Louis’ </span>official portrait<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and hung over Louis’ throne.

The introduction of glass negatives in 1851 precipitated a decline in the use of paper negatives.

It was later published as a book and reached a wider audience. In it he described the </span>squalid living conditions of the slums<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where people </span>lived without ventilation or sanitation in overcrowded rooms.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He described this scene: “It was photographed by flash-light on just such a visit. In a room not thirteen feet either way slept twelve men and women, two or three in bunks set in a sort of alcove, the rest on the floor. A kerosene lamp burned dimly in the fearful atmosphere, probably to guide other and later arrivals to their ‘beds,’ for it was only just past midnight. A baby’s fretful wail came from an adjoining hall-room, where, in the semi-darkness, three recumbent figures could be made out. The ‘apartment’ was one of three in two adjoining buildings we had found, within half an hour, similarly crowded. </span>Most of the men were lodgers, who slept there for five cents a spot<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div>Riis was a journalist, not an artist<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but </span>he used a brand new photographic technique:<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>flash powder (Blitzlicht, invented in 1887)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Flash powder was </span>a mixture of magnesium with potassium chlorate<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and some antimony sulfide for added stability. Riis lit the magnesium powder on a frying pan. The process involved removing the lens cap, igniting the flash powder and replacing the lens cap; the time taken to ignite the flash powder sometimes allowed a visible image blurring created by the flash. </span>The introduction of flash photography made it possible for Riis to photograph the darkest corners of society<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, like this overcrowded lodging room with no light. It also allowed him to take photos at night when the worst conditions were most apparent.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span>use of flash photography <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to </span>document the dark places<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the city where no one willingly ventured </span>allowed Riis to capture the unflinching realities of life<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the city </span>and bring it to those who had the power to make change.&nbsp;</div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outcry from Riis’ journalistic photography brought about a</span> reform<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> movement.

He served as the</span> third and last director of the<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>Bauhaus<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Dessau from 1930 to 1933.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His work is unmistakable in its </span>clarity<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span>rigor<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with which it embodies the principles of </span>rationalism and functionalism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as in its spatial qualities, material expression and detailing. Mies had </span>four guiding principles<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: the search for </span>clarity of construction<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; </span>reduction to a<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>few formal elements<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span>simple architectural design<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; </span>a constructional logic derived from the materials<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; and the </span>principle of simplicity and continuity between indoors and outdoors<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Space for Mies was something that continues beyond its physical limits and creates connections between inside and outside.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Mies, </span>technological advances<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were a driving force of architecture, a spirit of the times that architecture should embrace and express.&nbsp; Between 1921 and 1925 he developed five visionary studies, including this </span>amoeba-like design<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Glass Skyscraper</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (1922) consisting of a core and three wings with rounded forms, which followed his radical proposal for the </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Friedrichstrasse Skyscraper Project</span> (1921), the first example<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of his </span>“skin-and-bones” architecture<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that was to dominate his later designs. Although none of the five projects were realized because they were highly </span>idealized<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they were presented in international exhibitions on modern architecture. To this day, they are regarded as </span>remarkably innovative designs<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span>the degree zero<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of his career and of a certain strain of modern architecture.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of </span>glass<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a material for Mies is evident in this design, </span>where the ‘window’ as a link to the surroundings and indicator of human scale was replaced by a facade of continuous glass planes that responds universally to its surroundings <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span>became generalized as an expression<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the </span>International Style<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It also reflected the more fantastic visions of </span>Expressionist<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> architects and artists, who were drawn to glass as a symbol of purity and renewal. Mies interpreted </span>transparency<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in two respects: literally, as a property of light- and air-permeable materials and figuratively, as a means of spatial arrangement in which different spaces can be seen at once.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unprecedented design is distinguished by its </span>crystalline plan, the daring use of glass<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and an </span>expressive silhouette<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that seemed to</span> owe nothing to history. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conceived only a few years after the end of WWI, this seminal project presented a bold vision of the skyscraper as a </span>new architectural typology for the modern metropolis<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span>anticipating the proliferation of the tall steel-and-glass buildings that have since become ubiquitous in cities worldwide.</div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A decade later Mies took part, together with Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and J.J.P.

But he castigated this as \"extract art,\" having nothing to do with real abstraction, which, he said, \"cannot be 'used' in education, communication, perception, foreign relations, etc.\" It was for this reason that Reinhardt truly wanted a \"new academy,\" which would function like those of the seventeenth century: protecting a notion of aesthetic purity and maintaining the difference between high art and its applied derivatives. Such an academy would make clear, he said, that art is essentially \"'out of time,' art made fine, art emptied and purified of all other- than-art meanings.\"</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His own attempt to purify abstraction took the form of marrying the two major paradigms of abstraction: the grid and the monochrome.

With the Black paintings Reinhardt said: \"I'm merely making the last paintings which anyone can make.\"&nbsp; (lol)</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Reinhardt applied his colors with brushes, he did so without leaving the slightest trace of his implement on the surface.

This image is part of a set of modifications that Jorn produced in 1962, called “new disfigurations.” These were mostly portraits of proper subjects disfigured by childish doodles or deranged doubles.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some critics, the “modifications” crack open traditional genres that have become academic kitsch in order to make them live again as contemporary signs. In doing so, they overcome, symbolically at least, the split between avant-garde and kitsch that long deformed modern culture.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original painting depicts a young girl in a white confirmation dress. She is clutching a skipping rope and fixing the audience in her gaze with a smile. Jorn embellished this picture, an amateur version of a classical 19</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">century academic portrait, by painting a moustache and a goatee on the girl’s face and scrawling the words ‘L’avant-garde se rend pas’ across the black background.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;‘L’avant-garde se rend pas’ has been interpreted as a paraphrase on Marcel Duchamp’s work L.H.O.O.Q in which he added a moustache and goatee to a reproduction of the Mona Lisa. The disfiguration of the painting indicates that the bourgeois conception of art and artistic genius has become outdated, that the drawing of a mustache on the Mona Lisa is no more interesting than the original version of the painting.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement accompanying his show on modifications in 1959, Jorn writes, “Painting is over. You might as well finish it off.” One can read the disfiguration as an admission of the pathetic status of bourgeois art– that the avant-garde should give up.&nbsp;</span></div></b><br>",

Kitsch was embedded in his works from the very beginning of his career: with him, the wall separating commercial kitsch from avant-garde art had become utterly porous.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. &nbsp; As a participant and witness to the carnage of the world wars, Fontana harnessed the existential dread of a battle-worn generation and slashed through his monochrome canvases starting in 1949. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fontana’s proposal is the abolition of illusory space and its substitution with real space, by piercing, or slashing canvas with a razor to create an actual dimension of space. He developed these principles in his concept of Spatialism, published in the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Manifiesto Blanco</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (1946), and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Manifiesto Spaziale</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (1947), which called for an art that embraced science and technology.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. &nbsp; From the start of the 1960s, he began a series of “Olii” (oils) on canvas, where the thick painting layer is perforated with holes or gashes. In a quest for iconographic renewal, he developed a series of paintings titled “the End of God,” a series of monochrome canvases, at times covered in sequins and cut through with holes or gashes.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. &nbsp; In Fontana’s hands, oil paint, a material of pictorial art, becomes a repugnant past. The myriad holes that puncture his canvases highlight the materiality of the support.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. &nbsp; The fake gems, diamond dust sparkles and acidic colors of the oval shaped canvases from </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">the End of God </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series adds a playful twist to the kitsch– taking the forms of marvelling of the domains of postwar spectacle: television, fashion, commercial fairs and discotheque decors.&nbsp;</span></div></b>",

Set on the floor or in relation to the gallery walls, these polyhedrons defined the gallery’s architecture as sculpture rarely had before, directing the viewer’s focus to the space itself.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between 1962 and 1964, Morris produced seven grey painted, simple plywood sculptures intended for this landmark exhibition.

The value of the artist’s hand was inimical to Morris, and the work of art became, in theory, not an original object but a representation of the idea from which it was conceived. This notion allowed for the creation and destruction of the piece when necessary, allowing for it to refabricated each time it was exhibited.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exhibition was critiqued by Judd, who did not find the work to be environmental, “The work looks well together, but it isn’t an environment; there are seven separate pieces.

                "<b><div>Conceptual art</div><ol><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Kawara (1932 – 2014) was a Japanese conceptual artist who lived in New York City from 1965. He took part in many solo and group exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale in 1976.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From January 4, 1966, Kawara made a long series of \"Date paintings\" (the Today series), which consist entirely of</span> the date on which the painting was executed in simple white lettering set against a solid background.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The date is always documented in the language and grammatical conventions of the country in which the painting is executed.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The originality of each work, its small difference from the others, becomes a possibility for a confrontation with the daily events of the world. Since its meaning is not predetermined, the real work of the piece lies ahead, in the encounter with the viewer, when it is exposed to the world. The vision it offers us is a moment in world history, yet it is </span>an unnamed moment<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dates on the paintings, hand-painted with calculated precision, are always centered on the canvas and painted white, whereas the background colors vary. Four coats of paint are carefully applied for the ground and each allowed enough time to dry before being rubbed down in preparation for subsequent coats.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eschewing stencils in favor of hand-drawn characters, each work is carefully executed by hand. Some days he made more than one. When Kawara was unable to complete the painting on the day it was started he immediately destroyed it.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a Date Painting is not exhibited, it is placed in a cardboard box custom-made for the painting, which is lined with a </span>clipping from a local newspaper from the city in which the artist made the painting<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; most clippings are from The New York Times. Although the boxes are part of the work, they are rarely exhibited. Each year between 63 and 241 paintings were made.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each Date Painting is registered in a journal and marked on a One Hundred Years Calendar. When Kawara finished a painting, he applied a swatch of the paint mixture he used to a small rectangle that was then glued onto a chart in the journal. The 48 journals record the details of the painting's size, color and newspaper headline, while the calendar uses colored dots to indicate the days in which a painting was made, and to record the number of days since the artist's birth. Kawara created nearly 3,000 date paintings in more than 112 cities worldwide in a project that was planned to end only with his death.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The significance of these paintings lies in the fact that they depict not only a date, but also </span>their own date<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If, historically, paintings have been fixed in time by a date on the front or back of the canvas, the date itself for Kawara becomes the subject of the painting and the sole embodiment of the work's figurative imagery.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kawara made the passage of time itself the all-important subject by each day starting a small black painting that simply set forth the current date in white block letters. With every panel an equal component in the series, </span>the work can reveal its full meaning only as a total conception.</div></li></ol></b>",

Photography in Baldassari and the other conceptual photographer’s hands (Dan Graham, Kosuth Nauman) becomes a randomly accumulated set of indexical traces of images, objects, contexts, behaviors, or interactions.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But unlike Kosuth and the other conceptual photographers who turned Duchamp and the readymade into doctrine, Baldessari took his subversive legacies and applied them to the false orthodoxies with which Conceptualism was about to install itself as the new authoritative movement. Baldessari’s work anticipated these new art-world pieties early on: he annihilated them with an antiartistic humor.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this photographic print on canvas Baldessari depicts an issue of Artforum magazine that features a reproduction of Frank Stella’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Union III </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(1966) on its cover. Beneath the printed photograph, he hired a professional sign painter to write the caption “This is not to be looked at,” paradoxically implying that visual contemplation is neither the best nor only way to engage with art.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The title is a translation of “no se puede mirar,” the title of a work from Francisco Goya’s series of etchings </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">The Disasters of War </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(1820). The pairing of the title with Stella’s painting on the ARtforum cover constructs a critique of formalist and literalism of high modernist painting, including reference to the statement of Frank Stella, “What you see is what you see.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His bald-faced appropriation and layering of preexisting images, as well as his hiring of another painter to complete the work, demonstrates his skepticism about artistic originality.

I was weary of doing relational painting and began wondering if straight information would serve, I sought to use language not as a visual element but as something to read. That is, a notebook entry about painting could replace the painting. And visual data less as pleasing artistically than as documentation, as in a store catalogue or police photograph […] Important was that I was the strategist. Someone else built and primed the canvases and took them to the sign painter, the texts are quotations from art books and the sign painter was instructed not to attempt to make attractive artful lettering but to letter the information in the most simple way.”</span></div></li></ol></b>",

A dirty, penile object in latex over plaster, this work is a “disagreeable object” (a term used by Giacometti). By using&nbsp; the materiality of latex, she achieves a fleshy, tactile texture in the sculpture</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. &nbsp; &nbsp; According to Freud, women might associate penis and baby in order to compensate the lack of the first with the gain of the second. But this “little girl” is represented not as a fetish object or penis substitute but a personage in her own right. In this regard, the work is a bold gesture: as a feminist appropriation of the symbolic phallus.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a work fraught with ambivalence. When hung by a wire, as it is often displayed, it appears as an object of hate, a castrated piece of meat. But when cradled, as it is by Bourgeois in a well-known photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe. Whether lovingly cradled or brutally dangled, the contrary nature of the work epitomizes Bourgeois’s intense and mixed feelings towards mother&nbsp; hood, masculinity and sexuality.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. &nbsp; &nbsp; While there is much in her work that refers to her troubled relationship with her philandering father, as a wife and mother of three sons, Bourgeois also viewed masculinity as something more vulnerable; she says, “The phallus is a subject of my tenderness. Everything I loved had the shape of the people around me– the shape of my husband, the shape of the children. So, when I wanted to represent something I loved, I obviously represented a little penis.”&nbsp;</span></div></b>",

The artist has described the procedure as a largely methodical one that advances “ladleful by ladleful,” beginning at one end of the wall and finishing at the other.

By internalizing these artistic languages, Hesse was able to transform them, introducing messy carnal associations into their clean conceptual assumptions.</span></div></li></ol></b>",

Like </span>Andy Warhol<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hanson saw </span>boredom and banality<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as key characteristics of post-war, consumer society (although the bored affect is perhaps a modern rather than postwar condition - see </span>Neue Sachlichkeit<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This work is Polyester resin and fibreglass, painted in oil, and mixed media.

Their clothing marks them as temporally-specific, rooted in the 1970s.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of their materiality the figures are somewhat reminiscent of mannequins (we might think of the Dada and Surrealist fascination with mannequins, and Atget’s photographs of shop windows.) Rather than the idealized bodies of most mannequins, however, these figures have the lumps and bumps of real people.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although these two figures are presented as a couple, they were cast from life, one after the other, and never met.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building on the legacy of Minimalism, which shared a real space with the viewer, these works have no clear delineation between viewer and artwork.

Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the </span>hyperreal<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and of simulation. It is no longer a question of a false representation of reality (ideology), but of concealing the fact that the </span>real is no longer real<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and thus of saving the reality principle.”</span></div></li></ol><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun fact: Hanson lived in Florida, which - honestly totally tracks.

Along the way he expresses his ideas about time, movement, and place by making small marks on the earth, e.g. “suck[ing] icicles from the grass stems.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This work records a walk he made on Dartmoor during New Year 1971-2, repeatedly following a&nbsp; pre-determined circular route that he sketched out on the presented map. In the work he records his experience of sounds heard on the walk, how he became away of the presence of rivers as he approached them, pockets of sounds in gullies, and how the sound disappeared behind him as he walked on. The work incorporates both the internal feelings and thoughts of the artist and the external aspects of his experience.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Corrina, Corrina” is a reference to a song by Bob Dylan. The photograph below the text was taken during the walk, looking forward in the direction Long was walking.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These works seem indebted to the instructional work of the Fluxus artists, in that the final texts works document, or perhaps even guide the action the artist’s take (unclear if he writes the text before or after doing the walk). It therefore is unclear whether the walk itself is the artwork or the text representing it is. In much of his work with the land, he broadened the idea of sculpture, photography, etc. to be a part of performance art and conceptual art.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also engages with the popular land art movement of the 1970s in which sculptors were altering or manipulating the land as artworks. Long’s work is one of the less invasive forms of land art of this group, and is far more aligned with conceptualism than that of Smithson, de Maria or Heizer.

Piano and Rogers (both not famous at the time) won an international competition and were chosen to be the architects of the project; their design was selected for exemplifying constructivism and a high tech modern structure.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It houses France’s national museum of modern art, a public library, an AV center, a rooftop restaurant and an internet café. The idea for a multicultural complex, bringing together in one place different forms of art and literature developed in part from the ideas of France’s first Minister of Cultural Affairs, André Malraux, a wester proponent of the decentralization of art and culture.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By making visible all the building’s mechanical and structural elements, the Pompidou Center would seem to fulfil the modernist preference for truth to materials and formal integrity. The Pompidou takes the Bauhaus pragmatism and technology as its point of departure, only to transform them into a surreal dream of pipes and trusses, marine funnels and vents, most of which festoon the exoskeleton.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their design portrayed the museum itself as a movement. The skeleton engulfs the building from its exterior, showing all the different mechanical and structural systems, not only so they could be understood but also to maximise the interior space without interruptions. The different systems on the exterior are painted in different colors to distinguish their different roles.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its time, the design achieved a new standard in open-space flexibility.

Thus, while the design incorporated the black-and-white lines of an adjacent modernist skyscraper in a graduated series of concentric rings, the circular form itself—essentially Italian Baroque in character—reflects the local community.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At staggered intervals on either side of a cascading fountain at the Piazza d’Italia are various </span>column screens representing the five classical orders, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the outermost and richest one, Corinthian, crowned by polished stainless-steel capitals supporting an entablature emblazoned with dedicatory Latin inscriptions.

The building was criticized for “superficially” incorporating a traditional aesthetic without allowing said traditional elements to be functional.

A text describes the story as narrated by three of the other residents, one of whom happened to know the cosmonaut better than the others yet admits, “I didn’t know him well.” The room still contains the contraption, a gaping hole in the ceiling, and scientific drawings and diagrams tacked to a wall that is covered with wallpaper composed of old Soviet propaganda posters along with debris left behind (broken dishes, simple furniture and clothing).

These objects would become a hallmark of his practice, and it marks the emergence of the </span>degraded \"junk\" aesthetic<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cultivated by artists in the late 1980s and 1990s, from Jason Rhoades to Thomas Hirschhorn.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span>companion sculpture<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a collection of </span>melted candles<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">The Wages of Sin,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> becomes a shrine to the power of teen angst and implies a child’s rite of passage into the adult worlds of labor, debt, and atonement.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together with the autobiographical, </span>Catholic overtones<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of its companion piece, the works connote themes of devotion, longing and debt, tinged with nostalgia for the innocence of childhood, while pointing with bitter humor to the disenchantments of adulthood.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1960s, artists became interested in </span>repetition and accumulation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as almost mechanical techniques that downplayed the role of individual expression; here, Kelley questions that impulse. Given the materials he uses, accumulation doesn't result in just more of the same, but creates layers of association, memory, feeling, and meaning. Together they offer an altar of unabashed sentimentality, a sly assault on the high-minded aesthetics of 20th-century abstract painting and minimalism. The works' </span>deflation of the ideals of high modernism<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is of a piece with its general aura of emotional and spiritual disillusionment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div></li></ol><div>Not so fun fact:<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This landmark work was recreated in an empty lot near his studio in Los Angeles as a spontaneous memorial after he committed suicide in 2012.

(Serrano was brought up as a strict Roman Catholic.) For </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Piss Christ</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a crucifix was submerged in a tank of the artist’s urine, which was placed against a red backdrop.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serrano is influenced by </span>Straight Photography<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - the image (like many of his other works, which often center supposedly abject subjects) is not manipulated.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span>title<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> inflects the viewer’s interpretation of the work - without it, the photograph perhaps recalls depictions of a golden, glowing Christ in children’s Bibles, or the treatment of light in paintings by Caravaggio.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"At the time I made Piss Christ, I wasn't trying to get anything across,\" Serrano recalled. \"In hindsight, I'd say Piss Christ is a reflection of my work, not only as an artist, but as a Christian.\" He continued, \"The thing about the crucifix itself is that we treat it almost like a fashion accessory. When you see it, you're not horrified by it at all, but what it represents is the crucifixion of a man. And for Christ to have been crucified and laid on the cross for three days where he not only bled to death, he shat himself and he peed himself to death. So if </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Piss Christ</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> upsets you, maybe it's a good thing to think about what happened on the cross.\"</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1987, the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art (which was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts) awarded a $15,000 to Serrano; during this period, Serrano produced </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;\">Piss Christ, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leading Rev. Donald Wildmon (director of the American Family Association) to accuse him of “religious bigotry.” This - along with the NEA’s funding of a retrospective of Mapplethorpe’s work the same year - led to a debate in the US about </span>public arts funding<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often called the </span>Culture Wars<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (not to be confused with today’s culture wars). At a meeting of the US Senate the following May, Republican senator Jesse Helms said this of Serrano and his work: 'Mr President [George Bush, Sr.], he is not an artist. He is a jerk. And he is taunting the American people.' Ultimately, funding for the NEA was slashed and an anti-obscenity clause was inserted into NEA contracts (unconstitutionally, it was argued).</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Piss Christ has also been physically attacked numerous times, most recently when it was assaulted with chisel, hammer, and spray paint in Avignon in 2011.</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serrano is “not a political artist.” Sure, why not.&nbsp;</span></div></li></ol><br><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not at all fun fact: Serrano recently photographed 4 men who had been hooded while being tortured by the British authorities in 1971 (they were accused of being members of the IRA). “I wasn’t interested in photographing them as individuals, but as The Hooded Men, so I brought hoods with me.” He asked them to put hoods on for the photographs, reliving their trauma.&nbsp;</span></div><br><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*According to Serrano: </span><a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2017/10/art/ANDRES-SERRANO-with-Eleanor-Heartney\"><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 0, 204); font-weight: 400;\">https://brooklynrail.org/2017/10/art/ANDRES-SERRANO-with-Eleanor-Heartney</span></a></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**Not an accepted category but I stand by it.

Finding that a strictly abstract style was not suited to the stories he wanted to tell, Ligon has excerpted texts by Zora Neal Hurston, Walt Whitman, Jean Genet, Gertrude Stein, James Baldwin, Richard Pryor, and Ralph Ellison among others in his works.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ligon encourages the streaks left behind by oil sticks and stencils to progressively obscure the text on his canvases, experimenting with the subject of </span>legibility and erasure<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, particularly as they relate to race, and the </span>limits of signs<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He explains, “Oil paint wants to spread out and smudge and smear. And after about six months of trying to make perfect letters, I realized that the smudging and smearing and disappearance of the letters was way more interesting than trying to make a perfect letter form. And so the paintings became about that disappearance of language.” (c.f. </span>material specificity<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) As Ligon worked his way down the support, the text became progressively smudged and illegible because the greasy oil stick left a residue that adhered to the stencil. “The smearing also creates a visual interaction with the gesso ground, a metaphor for the interaction between blacks and whites in the </span>construction of racial identity<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” Ligon has said.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This oilstick-on-canvas work features an excerpt from Zora Neale Hurston’s 1928 essay “How It Feels to Be Colored Me,” in which the author describes leaving the protective black community of her childhood at age thirteen and suddenly being confronted with the issue of race - being a Black person in a white society.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describing what drew him to this text, Ligon has said: “I became really fascinated by those sentences that had the word ‘I’ in them—‘I feel most colored when I'm thrown against a sharp white background.’ The use of the word ‘I’ creates a kind of confusion. Is it the ‘I’ of the text that I'm quoting, or is it ‘I,’ Glenn Ligon, feel most colored? And so, the confusion between those two things was something I was interested in.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1989, Ligon’s first solo show, \"How It Feels to Be Colored Me,\" opened in Brooklyn.

At 303 Gallery in New York, he moved the private unseen rooms of the gallery, which contained the business office, the packing, and shipping areas, and all the other materials of its daily functioning, into its public viewing spaces.

Many writers identify the red paint on the child’s left hand with blood. The perceived threat of the image is bolstered by the painting’s monumental scale (over 6’ tall) and the child’s shadowed eyes.

Most people don’t die in the middle of a square or on a beautiful boulevard; their deaths rarely happen in a strategic location, even famous people don’t die in « the center ». There is no hierarchy of location between anonymous and famous people. There are unexpected locations. The location is important not in relationship to the layout of the city, but in relation to the people who died. This gives me the plan for locating the altars. These altars are questioning the status of a monument today by </span>their form, by their location, and by their duration<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Thus, the choice of location is determining for my statement on work in public space and my critique of monuments.The forms of these homages are alike, whether made for celebrities or made for the unknown: candles, flowers, often wrapped in transparent paper, teddy bears and stuffed animals, written messages on scraps of paper with hearts and other love symbols. With this wild mixture of forms, the messages of love and attachment to the deceased person are expressed without any aesthetic concern; it is this personal commitment that interests me.</span> It comes from the heart. It is pure energy. One is not preoccupied with the form-quality of the elements, but only with the message that is to be conveyed.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The forms of these altars, that are profane and not religious, convey a visual form based on weakness. The forms and locations of the altars show the precarious aspect of the work. It is because of necessity and urgency that they are there. The cruelty and the non-spectacular of these monuments makes them untouchable by people walking by, proprietors, street-cleaners, dog-walkers, policemen. Everyone could be concerned. Everyone is concerned. These altars will disappear sooner or later. The average duration of the altars is of two weeks. The disappearance of the altar is as important as its presence. The memory of what is important doesn’t need a monument.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such works, which exist s</span>omewhere between a public installation an obscure performance, and a private archive<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, can also be found in nonart spaces, which might render them even more difficult to decipher in aesthetic terms; nonetheless, they can be taken to indicate a distinctive turn in recent art.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They draw on a wide range of artistic precedents such as the performative objects of Fluxus, the humble materials of Arte Povera, and the site-specific strategies of institution-critical artists like Marcel Broodthaers, Michael Asher, and Hans Haacke. </span>Yet the current generation has also transformed the familiar devices of the readymade collaboration, and installation.</div></li></ol></b>",

In an age in which information can be accessed anywhere, it is the simultaneity of media and (more importantly) the curatorship of its contents that will make the library vital.”</span></div></li><li><div><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mixing Chamber, on the third floor, is an area of librarian-patron interaction – a trading floor for information orchestrated to fulfill an essential (though often neglected) need for expert interdisciplinary help. Librarians guide readers up into the four-story Books Spiral, a continuous ramp of shelving with sections designed to be flexible and to expand as the library’s holdings grow. This designing of spaces to </span>facilitate interraction<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span>anticipate shifting future needs<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is typical of OMA’s approach to design.</span></div></li></ol></b>",
